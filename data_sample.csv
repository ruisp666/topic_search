Assurant, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2004. 

We are a leading global business services company that supports, protects and connects major consumer purchases. We support the advancement of the connected world by partnering with the world&#8217;s leading brands to develop innovative solutions and to deliver an enhanced customer experience. We operate in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific through two operating segments: Global Lifestyle and Global Housing. Through our Global Lifestyle segment, we provide mobile device solutions, extended service products and related services for consumer electronics and appliances, and credit and other insurance products (referred to as &#8220;Connected Living&#8221;); and vehicle protection, leased and financed solutions and other related services (referred to as &#8220;Global Automotive&#8221;). Through our Global Housing segment, we provide lender-placed homeowners insurance, lender-placed manufactured housing insurance and lender-placed flood insurance (referred to as &#8220;Lender-placed Insurance&#8221;); renters insurance and related products (referred to as &#8220;Multifamily Housing&#8221;); and voluntary manufactured housing insurance, voluntary homeowners insurance and other specialty products (referred to as &#8220;Specialty and Other&#8221;). Effective January 1, 2023, we realigned the composition of our reportable segments. See &#8220;&#8212;Segments&#8221; below for additional information. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

Our financial strength and capabilities across our businesses create competitive advantages that we believe allow us to support our clients, deliver superior experience for their customers and drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. 

Our financial strength. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, we had $33.12 billion in total assets and our debt to total capital was 33.5%. Our Global Lifestyle and Global Housing segments generate significant operating cash flows, which provides us with the flexibility to make investments to strengthen our strategic capabilities and enhance our partnerships with our clients. 

Insights and capabilities enable innovation to meet evolving consumer needs. We have a deep understanding of our clients and the consumer markets they serve. We seek to leverage consumer insights, together with extensive capabilities, to identify and anticipate the needs of our clients and the consumers they serve. We intend to leverage those insights with investments in emerging technologies and operations, including digital-first solutions, to introduce innovative products and services and continuously adapt those offerings to the changing needs of the consumers in the connected world. 

Value chain integration and customer experience. We own or manage multiple pieces of the value chain, which enables us to create products and service offerings based on client and consumer needs and provide a seamless customer experience. Offering end-to-end solutions allows us to provide additional value for consumers and adapt more quickly and efficiently to their needs. Visibility across the value chain helps us leverage insights to further improve the customer experience and our offerings. Our ability to introduce value-added services and capabilities across the value chain and provide a superior customer experience allows us to strengthen our partnerships and our competitive position. 

Our Strategy for Profitable Growth 

Our vision is to be the leading global business services company supporting the advancement of the connected world. As we focus on executing our vision, we believe we are positioned for continued long-term profitable growth by: 

Growing our portfolio of market-leading businesses . Our businesses represent a group of leading, service-oriented offerings focused on compelling growth opportunities. This includes capitalizing on the convergence of the connected world in the global markets and geographies in which we operate. We intend to grow our businesses by strengthening our partnerships with major clients and prospects globally, while continuing to invest in talent, capabilities and technology, including digital, to enable us to deliver a superior customer experience, as well as further broadening our offerings and diversifying our distribution channels. As our service offerings expand, we expect to generate a more diversified mix of business and earnings, with decreasing exposure to catastrophe risk. 

Providing integrated offerings through a superior, digital-first customer experience . As we continue to evolve our product and service capabilities and respond to client and consumer needs, we expect to accelerate the pace of innovation for our integrated offerings and drive additional value through a superior, digital-first customer experience. 

Deploying our capital strategically. We intend to maintain our strong financial position and our prudent capital management approach. We generally deploy capital to invest in and grow our businesses, pay dividends and repurchase shares. 

Our approach to mergers, acquisitions and other growth opportunities reflects our strategic and disciplined approach to capital management. We target new businesses and capabilities, organically and through acquisitions, that complement or support our strategy. 

Investing in talent. Our employees play a critical role in contributing to our success and supporting our business strategy. We believe in fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture to drive sustained profitable growth through innovation. We are focused on strategically attracting, developing, retaining and motivating our talent, as we prioritize programs and initiatives aimed at investing in our talent. 

2022 Highlights 

On January 1, 2022, Keith Demmings succeeded as the Company&#8217;s chief executive officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and joined the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;). Under his leadership, the Company made progress in executing on its vision to be the leading global services provider supporting the advancement of the connected world. We continued to strengthen partnerships with key clients and delivered new, innovative solutions, while navigating more volatile market conditions. We continued to execute on our commitment to being a socially responsible company for our stakeholders, including being recognized as a Great Place to Work and advancing goals to reduce our environmental impact. We remain focused on engaging and developing our diverse talent pool through enhanced leadership and skills development programs. 

Our business model represents a group of leading, service-oriented businesses supporting the connected world. In Global Lifestyle, our ability to continuously innovate our products and services supported a stronger and differentiated customer experience. In addition to key partner renewals, we secured new business opportunities and new client partnerships. In Global Housing, we initiated a business transformation, including exiting certain non-core businesses discussed below, as well as international catastrophe-exposed business, where we did not see a path to leadership positions. We took action to mitigate the impact of high inflation within our Lender-placed Insurance business and have continued to renew clients. While growth from our affinity partnerships in Multifamily Housing has slowed, our property management channel continues to expand. 

Broadly across the Company, we accelerated several initiatives to realize greater efficiencies to position us for continued long-term growth. This included realigning our organizational structure, including in Global Housing, to better deploy talent to support the diverse needs of our businesses. We also accelerated our ongoing real estate consolidation to support work-from-home arrangements given our increasingly hybrid workforce. We expect to complete these actions in 2023. The Company expects approximately $55 million in gross annualized run rate savings to be realized from these actions by year-end 2024, with more than half expected to be realized in 2023. These savings will mitigate the impact of higher labor costs and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment, as well as fund additional investments, including increasing automation. 

Throughout the year, we have maintained a strong balance sheet as we navigated macroeconomic uncertainty. In 2022, we returned $717.8 million to shareholders through share repurchases and common stock dividends, including the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the Global Preneed businesses. In June 2022, we redeemed $75.0 million of the $300.0 million then outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 4.20% Senior Notes due September 2023 at a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 

In conjunction with the CEO transition, we changed our segment measure of profitability for our reportable segments to an Adjusted EBITDA metric, as the primary measure used for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing performance, from segment net income from continuing operations, effective as of that date. In addition, in the second quarter of 2022, we made the decision to fully exit certain businesses, including the long-tail commercial liability businesses in Global Housing (sharing economy and small commercial businesses), as well as certain legacy long-duration insurance policies within Global Lifestyle (collectively referred to as &#8220;non-core operations&#8221;), and revised the calculation of our segment measure of profitability, Adjusted EBITDA. Prior period amounts have been revised accordingly. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information. 

Environment, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) priorities 

Assurant is a purpose-driven company committed to making meaningful advancements each year to integrate our sustainability efforts with our long-term strategy, global business operations and our product and service offerings. In 2022, we continued to make progress on building a more sustainable company for all of our stakeholders. Our Board, Management Committee and employees understand the importance of sustainability to deliver greater value as we operate our business each day and support Assurant&#8217;s long-term strategy. 

Our sustainability strategic framework centers on four pillars against which we track our progress on significant ESG topics core to our business, as discussed below. Each of these pillars is dynamic with multiple dimensions that we align to our long-term business strategy. 

Responsible employer. We are a responsible employer with a culture that values diversity, equity and inclusion, and recognizes the importance of investing in employee talent. For additional information, refer to &#8220;&#8211; Human Capital Resources&#8221; below. 

Impact on society. We actively engage to strengthen the communities where we live and work worldwide while operating our business and managing our investments with a meaningful environmental commitment. 

Customer commitment. We deliver differentiated experiences by being customer-centric and anticipating the needs of the people we serve. 

Integrity and ethics. We adhere to unwavering standards of integrity, ethics, governance, privacy and information security. 

Our longer-term strategic planning process, overseen by our Board, prioritized three multiyear ESG areas of focus: 

&#8226; Talent: Foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture to drive innovation for the benefit of all stakeholders, 

&#8226; Products: Help customers thrive in a connected world, and 

&#8226; Climate: Operate to minimize our carbon footprint and align our commitments to enhance climate action and environment performance. 

For additional information on our ESG priorities, including our most recent Sustainability report, please refer to our website at https://www.assurant.com/our-story/sustainability . The information found on our website and in such reports is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this Report. 

Segments &#160; 

The composition of our reportable segments matches how we view and manage our business. For additional information on our segments, see &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Effective January 1, 2023, we realigned the composition of our reportable segments to correspond with changes to the Global Housing operating structure. As a result, the Global Housing segment is now comprised of two key lines of business, Homeowners, and Renters and Other. Certain specialty products, mainly the Leased and Financed business, previously reported in the Global Housing segment are now reported in Global Lifestyle to better align with our go-to-market strategy. The realignment has no impact on our consolidated results and will be reflected beginning with first quarter 2023 reporting. 

Global Lifestyle 

##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Net earned premiums, fees and other income by product: Connected Living (1) $ 4,233.4 $ 4,303.2 $ 4,216.5 Global Automotive 3,702.7 3,436.9 3,115.1 Total $ 7,936.1 $ 7,740.1 $ 7,331.6 Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 753.4 $ 702.1 $ 636.0 Segment equity (2) $ 4,582.9 $ 4,559.1 $ 4,491.2 ##TABLE_END

&#160; 

(1) For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 46.2%, 47.7%, and 48.8%, respectively, of net earned premiums, fees and other income was from mobile products, 44.0%, 43.3%, and 42.2%, respectively, was from extended service contracts and 9.8%, 9.0%, and 9.0%, respectively, was from financial services and other products. 

(2) Segment equity does not include components of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), which is primarily comprised of net unrealized gains on securities, net of taxes. For additional information on total AOCI, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Our Products and Services 

The key lines of business in Global Lifestyle are: Connected Living, which includes mobile device solutions, extended service contracts (insurance policies and warranties) (&#8220;ESCs&#8221;) for consumer electronics and appliances, and credit and other insurance products; and Global Automotive. 

Connected Living: Through partnerships with mobile device carriers, retailers, multiple system operators (&#8220;MSOs&#8221;), original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) and financial and other institutions, we underwrite and provide administrative support and related services for ESCs. These contracts provide consumers with coverage on mobile devices and consumer electronics and appliances, protecting them from certain covered losses. We pay the cost of repairing or replacing these 

consumer goods in the event of loss, theft, accidental damage, mechanical breakdown or electronic malfunction after the manufacturer's warranty expires. Our strategy is to provide integrated service offerings to our clients that address all aspects of the insurance, ESC or warranty, including program design and marketing strategy, risk management, data analytics, customer support and claims handling, supply chain services, service delivery and repair and logistics management. For example, we provide end-to-end mobile device lifecycle solutions in our mobile business from when the device is received and inspected, repaired or refurbished, to when it is ultimately disposed of through a sale to a third-party or used to support an insurance claim. In addition to extended protection for multiple devices, our mobile offerings include trade-in and upgrade programs, premium technical support, including device self-diagnostic tools, and device disposition. We also sell repaired or refurbished mobile and other electronic devices. We provide in-store, same-day device repairs to customers through our nationwide network of nearly 500 Cell Phone Repair locations. We believe that with the required administrative capability, digital platforms enabling on-boarding, claims management and service delivery, supply chain management, technical support infrastructure, insurance underwriting capabilities and a variety of adjacent value-added services, like trade-in and upgrade and asset value recovery, we maintain a differentiated position in this marketplace. 

Within Connected Living, our global financial services business maintains a suite of protection and assurance products that deliver a combination of features and benefits for varying customer segment needs. With major financial services clients, we provide value-added financial services in the U.S. and internationally, ranging from credit insurance to inclusive credit card benefits and travel coverages. Although traditional credit insurance has been in decline in North America, traditional credit and travel and credit card benefit products remain a core offering in select international markets. 

Global Automotive: We underwrite and provide administrative services for vehicle service contracts (&#8220;VSCs&#8221;) and ancillary products providing coverage for vehicles, including automobiles, trucks, recreational vehicles, motorcycles, construction and agricultural equipment, as well as parts. For VSCs, we pay the cost of repairing a customer&#8217;s vehicle in the event of mechanical breakdown. For ancillary products, coverage varies, but, generally, we pay the cost of repairing, servicing or replacing parts or provide other financial compensation in the event of mechanical breakdown, accidental damage or theft. We provide integrated service offerings to our clients, including program design and marketing strategy, risk management, data analytics, customer support and claims handling, reinsurance facilitation, actuarial consulting, experiential and digital training and performance management. 

Distribution and Clients 

Global Lifestyle operates globally, with approximately 82% of its revenue from North America (the U.S. and Canada), 8% from Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru), 5% from Europe (the United Kingdom (the &#8220;U.K.&#8221;), France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands) and 5% from Asia Pacific (South Korea, China (and Hong Kong), Japan, Australia, India, Singapore and New Zealand) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Global Lifestyle focuses on establishing strong, long-term relationships with clients that are leaders in their markets, including leading distributors of our products and services. In Connected Living, we partner with mobile device carriers, retailers, MSOs, OEMs and financial and other institutions to market our mobile device solutions and with some of the largest OEMs, consumer electronics retailers, appliance retailers (including e-commerce retailers) and MSOs to market our ESC products and related services. In addition, we partner with financial institutions, insurers and retailers to market our credit insurance and embedded card offerings. In Global Automotive, we partner with auto dealers and agents, third-party administrators and manufacturers to market our vehicle protection, leased and financed solutions and other related services. 

Most of our distribution agreements are exclusive. Typically, these agreements are multi-year with terms generally between three and five years and allow us to integrate our administrative systems with those of our clients. 

Global Lifestyle is dependent on a few clients, in particular mobile device carriers, and the loss of any one or more such clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Business, Strategic and Operational Risks &#8211; Our revenues and profits may decline if we are unable to maintain relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties face financial, reputational or regulatory issues. &#8221; 

Our Addressable Markets and Market Activity 

The mobile protection market is a large and growing global market, characterized by growth in the &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; and evolving wireless standards, particularly the advent of 5G. While smartphone penetration in the U.S., Japanese and European markets is high, other markets are less mature and present growth opportunities. Global adoption of 5G by subscribers is a high priority for mobile device carriers in all markets. The worldwide used and refurbished smartphone market is also expected to continue to grow. 

Consumer needs relating to mobile devices are continuing to expand in scope. We believe there are growth opportunities in bundled protection products, which support customers as they take full advantage of the features and functions of their mobile devices through their daily interaction with a connected world. Customer support, device financing, buyback, trade-in 

and upgrade programs are some of the areas that continue to gain traction. Expanded capabilities like repair and logistics, technical support for customers and digital security allow us to create product and service offerings that customers find compelling. We believe there are additional growth opportunities in new device categories, such as accessories (e.g., ear buds, watches) and connected smart devices (e.g., smart speakers, laptops, tablets). 

Our business is subject to fluctuations in mobile device trade-in and upgrade volumes based on the release of new devices and carrier promotional programs, as well as customer preferences. As a general trend, we believe the average smartphone replacement cycle is lengthening, which may increase attachment rates for mobile protection offerings, including for our large, installed customer base. However, this trend may be reversed based on new technology and innovation. Recently, major manufacturers have expressed a temporary challenge in mobile device production resulting from COVID-related lockdowns in China, which limits available inventory and increases lead time for consumers ordering new devices. Based on publicly available information, we expect this to correct itself in the first half of 2023. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Business, Strategic and Operational Risks &#8211; Our mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices in our inventory, and to export compliance and other risks &#8221; 

In the vehicle sales markets, U.S. new vehicle sales have tempered as supply chain constraints, including chip shortages, and rising interest rates are creating headwinds in the used vehicle market. We expect new vehicle sales to increase as chip availability increases while the used vehicle market is expected to decline as sales shift to new vehicles. Assurant continues to expand our footprint in the U.S. by adding new dealership clients and growing our dealer and third-party administrator networks. We work closely with our global partners to develop innovative offerings that reflect the evolution of the auto market, such as our enhanced products for battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. In addition, new vehicle sales outside of the U.S. continue to grow in most markets. 

Consumers are becoming increasingly connected across their mobile devices, vehicles and homes, which is creating a global market for smart home devices and related services. As we continue into the &#8220;Connected Decade&#8221;, we believe it will create long-term opportunities for Assurant as consumers&#8217; lifestyles will increasingly intertwine with their connected ecosystems, which we call the connected world. Due to our capabilities, including device protection, premium technology support, service delivery and financing, as well as technology components such as dynamic fulfillment, which integrates a dynamic mobile claims management process with risk and fraud mitigation, we are well positioned to support customers as the smart home market continues to grow. 

In our financial services business, we anticipate continued declines in our traditional credit insurance in North America. Our focus is on expanding our partnerships with leading financial institutions to offer credit card benefit offerings to their customers. The traditional credit and travel and credit card benefit products are actively sold in select international markets. 

Risk Management 

We earn premiums on our insurance and warranty products and fees for our other services. We write a portion of our contracts on a retrospective commission basis. This allows us to adjust commissions on the basis of claims experience. Under these commission arrangements, our clients&#8217; compensation is based upon the actual losses incurred compared to premiums earned after a specified net allowance to us. We believe that these arrangements better align our clients&#8217; interests with ours and help us to better manage risk exposure. For additional risks relating to our Global Lifestyle segment, please see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Inventory 

In our mobile business, we carry inventory to meet the delivery requirements of certain clients. These devices are ultimately disposed of through sales to third parties. Our inventory includes devices and parts on consignment with our nationwide network of nearly 500 Cell Phone Repair locations through which we provide in-store repairs. Inventory levels may vary from period to period due to, among other things, differences between actual and forecasted demand, supply chain constraints, the addition of new devices and parts, and strategic purchases. Payment terms with clients also vary, which may result in less inventory financed by clients and more inventory financed with our own capital. 

We take various actions to manage our inventory, including monitoring our inventory levels, managing the timing of purchases and obtaining return rights for some programs and devices. However, the value of certain inventory will be adversely impacted by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the devices and parts, physical problems resulting from faulty design or manufacturing, increased competition, decreased consumer demand, including due to changes in customer preferences and changes in client promotions, supply chain constraints, growing industry emphasis on cost containment and adverse foreign trade relationships. No assurance can be given that we will be adequately protected against declines in inventory value. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Business, Strategic and Operational Risks &#8211; &#8220; Our mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices in our inventory, and to export compliance and other risks.&#8221; 

Seasonality 

We experience seasonal fluctuations that impact demand in each of our lines of business. For example, seasonality for ESCs and VSCs aligns with the seasonality of the retail and automobile markets. In addition, our mobile results, which align with the seasonality of mobile device sales and are affected by trade-in volumes, may fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the actual and anticipated timing and availability of the release of new devices and carrier promotional programs.

(1) Segment equity does not include components of AOCI, which is primarily comprised of net unrealized gains on securities, net of taxes. For additional information on total AOCI, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Our Products and Services 

The key lines of business in Global Housing are: Lender-placed Insurance; Multifamily Housing (which is comprised of renters insurance and related products); and Specialty and Other (which is comprised of voluntary manufactured housing insurance, voluntary homeowners insurance and other specialty products). 

Lender-placed Insurance: We provide lender-placed homeowners, lender-placed manufactured housing and lender-placed flood insurance as described below. 

Lender-placed homeowners insurance . Lender-placed homeowners insurance consists principally of fire and dwelling hazard insurance offered through our lender-placed program. The lender-placed program provides collateral protection to lenders, mortgage servicers and investors in mortgaged properties in the event that a homeowner does not maintain insurance on a mortgaged dwelling. Lender-placed homeowners insurance provides structural coverage, similar to that of a standard homeowners policy. The amount of coverage is often based on the last known insurance coverage under the prior policy for the property and provides replacement cost coverage on the property. It protects both the lender&#8217;s interest and the borrower&#8217;s interest and equity. We also provide real estate owned (&#8220;REO&#8221;) insurance, consisting of insurance on foreclosed properties managed by our clients. 

In the majority of cases, we use proprietary insurance-tracking administration systems linked with the administrative systems of our clients to monitor clients&#8217; mortgage portfolios to verify the existence of insurance on each mortgaged property and identify those that are uninsured. If there is a potential lapse in insurance coverage, we begin a process of notification and outreach to both the homeowner and the last known insurance carrier or agent through phone calls and written correspondence, which generally takes up to 90 days to complete. If coverage cannot be verified at the end of this process, the mortgage servicer procures a lender-placed policy. The process of tracking voluntary coverage - including determining whether voluntary coverage is in force, the policy limits in place, the perils insured and the deductibles, and obtaining other required insurance related information - is part of our risk exposure management for our Lender-placed Insurance business. The exposure management process is needed in order to underwrite the risk we assume, to understand loss exposure and to communicate with appropriate parties, including the lender, insurance agent and homeowner. Our placement rates reflect the ratio of insurance policies placed to loans tracked. The homeowner always retains the option to obtain or renew the insurance of his or her choice. 

Lender-placed manufactured housing insurance. Lender-placed manufactured housing insurance consists principally of fire and dwelling hazard insurance for manufactured housing offered through our lender-placed program. Lender-placed manufactured housing insurance is issued after an insurance tracking and exposure management process similar to that described above. In most cases, tracking is performed using a proprietary insurance-tracking administration system. 

Lender-placed flood insurance . Lender-placed flood insurance consists of flood insurance offered through our lender-placed program. It provides collateral protection to lenders in mortgaged properties in the event a homeowner does not maintain required flood insurance. Lender-placed flood insurance is issued after an insurance tracking and exposure management process similar to that described above. 

Multifamily Housing: We provide integrated solutions across the resident lifecycle. We offer renters insurance for a wide variety of single and multi-family rental properties, providing content protection for renters&#8217; personal belongings and liability protection for the property owners against renter-caused damage. We also offer an integrated billing and tracking platform for our clients and their customers. In addition, we provide tenant bonds as an alternative to security deposits, which allows our clients to offer a lower move-in cost option while minimizing the risk of loss from damages, and receivables management, which helps our clients to maximize the collection of amounts owed by prior tenants. 

Specialty and Other: We offer voluntary manufactured housing insurance, voluntary condominium and homeowners insurance and other specialty products. Our voluntary insurance generally provides structural coverage, contents and liability coverage. We are also the second largest administrator for the U.S. government under the voluntary National Flood Insurance Program (the &#8220;NFIP&#8221;), for which we earn fees for collecting premiums and processing claims. This business is 100% reinsured to the U.S. government. 

Distribution and Clients 

Global Housing establishes long-term relationships with leading mortgage lenders and servicers, manufactured housing lenders, property managers and financial, insurance and other institutions. Lender-placed Insurance products are distributed primarily through mortgage lenders, mortgage servicers and financial and other institutions. The majority of our lender-placed agreements are exclusive. Typically, these agreements have terms of three to five years and allow us to integrate our systems with those of our clients. Multifamily Housing products are distributed primarily through property management companies and affinity marketing partners. We offer our Specialty and Other insurance programs primarily through manufactured housing lenders and retailers, along with independent specialty agents. Independent specialty agents also distribute flood products and other specialty property products. 

Global Housing is dependent on a few clients, and the loss of any one or more such clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Business, Strategic and Operational Risks &#8211; Our revenues and profits may decline if we are unable to maintain relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties face financial, reputational or regulatory issues.&#8221; 

Our Addressable Markets and Market Activity 

With respect to the lender-placed market, placement rates have been and are expected to continue to be generally flat. We continue to monitor the state of the overall housing market and the potential impact of loan modifications, forbearances and foreclosure delays, including the impact to REO volumes. Should the housing market deteriorate for a prolonged period, we would expect a longer-term increase in our placement rates over time. In addition to the overall market, our lender-placed results are also impacted by inflation, which has and may continue to increase the costs of paying claims, and the mix of loans we service. 

The U.S. renters insurance market is a growing market with new building development, occupancy and relocation trends. We believe there is opportunity to increase our market share and attachment rates with new and existing clients through our investments in digital platforms designed to deliver superior, digital-first customer experience and our expanded offerings to provide end-to-end solutions. 

Risk Management 

We earn premiums on our insurance products and fees for our services. Our lender-placed insurance products are not underwritten on an individual policy basis. Contracts with our clients require us to issue these policies automatically when a borrower&#8217;s insurance coverage is not maintained. These products are priced to factor in the additional risk from ensuring that all client properties have continuous insurance coverage. We monitor pricing adequacy based on a variety of factors and adjust pricing as required, subject to regulatory constraints. For additional risks related to pricing and modeling, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; We may be unable to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, which could reduce our profitability &#8221; and &#8220; &#8211; Actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management. &#8221; 

Because several of our business lines (such as homeowners, manufactured housing and other property policies) are exposed to catastrophe risks, we purchase reinsurance coverage to reduce our financial exposure, protect capital, and mitigate earnings and cash flow volatility. Our reinsurance program generally incorporates a provision to allow for the reinstatement of coverage, which provides protection against the risk of multiple catastrophes in a single year. 

For 2022, our property catastrophe reinsurance program includes U.S. per-occurrence catastrophe coverage providing $1.16 billion of protection in excess of $80.0 million retention in the main reinsurance program for a first event. In addition, it includes multi-year reinsurance contracts covering approximately 45% of the U.S. program, reducing volatility in future reinsurance costs. All layers of the program allow for one automatic reinstatement, except the first layer which has two reinstatements and covers the first $30.0 million of losses in excess of the $80.0 million retention. The 2022 program also 

maintains a cascading feature that provides multi-event protection in which higher coverage layers (Layers 3 through 6) drop down to $110.0 million as the lower layers and reinstatement limit are exhausted. Layer 7 does not cascade, with a retention of $955.0 million and a limit of $290.0 million. When combined with the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, the U.S. program is covered for gross Florida losses of up to approximately $1.34 billion. The 2022 catastrophe reinsurance program also includes Caribbean catastrophe coverage providing $150.0 million, including a $2.0 million co-participation on the top layer, in excess of a $20.0 million retention. 

For our 2023 catastrophe reinsurance program, costs have increased, generally in line with expectations. As of January 2023, approximately 64% of the 2023 program was placed and we anticipate elevated pricing will continue in June. 

We are also subject to non-catastrophe risk from isolated fire, water and wind damage, theft and vandalism, as well as general liability in renters and homeowners policies. Losses are impacted by increases in inflation and supply chain disruptions that increase the cost of materials and labor required to settle claims. Please see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Business, Strategic and Operational Risks &#8211; Catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses, including as a result of climate change and the current inflationary environment, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition .&#8221; 

Seasonality 

We experience seasonal fluctuation in several of our lines of business, which are exposed to the risk of catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses. Catastrophe events such as hurricanes typically occur in the second half of the year, and may increase in frequency and severity due to climate change. We also experience some seasonal fluctuation in non-catastrophe weather-related claims that tend to occur in the first half of the year. 

Competition 

Our businesses focus on supporting, protecting and connecting major consumer purchases. Although we face global competition in each of our businesses, we believe that no single competitor competes against us in all of our business lines. Across Global Lifestyle and Global Housing, we compete for business, customers, agents and other distribution relationships with many insurance companies, warranty and protection companies, financial services companies, mobile device repair and logistics companies, technology and software companies and specialized competitors that focus on one market, product or service. We must respond to the threat of disruption by traditional players, as well as from new entrants, such as &#8220;Insurtech&#8221; start-up companies and others. Competition in each business is based on a number of factors, including scope of products and services offered, ability to tailor products and services to client and consumer needs, product features and terms, pricing, technology offerings, diversity of distribution resources, brand recognition, costs, financial strength and ratings, resources, and quality of service, including speed of claims payment and the overall customer experience. The relative importance of these factors varies by product and market. To remain competitive in many of our businesses, we must also anticipate and respond effectively to changes in customer preferences, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, disruptive technology developments and alternate business models. For further information on the risks associated with competition, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Business, Strategic and Operational Risks &#8211; Significant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations. &#8221; 

Human Capital Resources 

A cornerstone of Assurant is the employees who bring our purpose, values and commitments to life each day for the millions of customers we serve worldwide. We believe in fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture to drive sustained profitable growth through innovation. We regularly evaluate our policies, practices and programs to ensure we continue to attract, develop and retain the best talent to support our strategy. This includes ongoing investments in competitive total rewards and wellbeing offerings, and providing programs for learning, development and engagement, while continuously enhancing the experience of our employees who are critical to our long-term success. 

As of December 31, 2022, Assurant had approximately 13,700 employees in 21 countries. Our diverse workforce spans a wide range of roles and skills to further our vision of supporting the advancement of the connected world. While 80% of our employee base was located in North America, we continued to expand our presence in key international markets across Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific to support our increasingly global client portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 64% of our employees were frontline workers, inclusive of hourly roles such as customer care, claims administration and mobile repair and logistics. The remaining 36% were in managerial roles, inclusive of salaried employees engaged in an array of business and support functions. As of December 31, 2022, 60% of our global workforce were female. In the U.S., our largest market, women accounted for 62% of employees while other underrepresented minority groups accounted for 53% of our domestic workforce. We continue to promote a more diverse and inclusive workforce across all levels of the Company in support of our business strategy. 

For full-year 2022, our global turnover rate was 25%, reflecting our blended workforce; turnover for managerial and salaried roles was 10%, generally consistent with the prior year despite an increasingly competitive market for talent. This compares to 32% turnover for frontline employees where turnover rates are typically higher. Following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen an increase in turnover in these roles reflecting the tight market for hourly workers in customer care and claims roles, as well as the larger concentration of in-store mobile service and repair technicians in the U.S. in 2022. 

The Board, through its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in conjunction with the Compensation Committee, oversee the significant human capital management programs of Assurant, which are led by Assurant&#8217;s CEO and its Chief Administrative Officer. 

Attracting, developing and retaining the best talent globally is key to our success in sustaining long-term profitable growth. In conjunction with the appointment of Keith Demmings as President and CEO in January 2022, we refreshed the composition of our Management Committee and evolved our organizational model and structure to support the execution of our strategy in alignment with our culture. In December 2022, we finalized a restructuring plan to further optimize our organizational structure in response to evolving business needs. We expect those actions will enable us to not only realize operational efficiencies, but also better leverage our global talent pool to support our business. 

Overall, our talent strategy is focused on employee engagement and investments in programs to support career development, as well as recognizing and rewarding performance. We believe these programs and opportunities create a diverse pipeline of talent and leadership necessary to drive and deliver on our long-term strategy. 

In 2022, we refreshed the key tenets of our culture, specifically to foster greater understanding of our renewed purpose and why the work we do each day matters to the stakeholders we serve, as well as the behaviors that drive success at Assurant. 

We regularly engage with our employees to seek feedback through an array of forums and channels, including one-on-one discussions with managers, interactive townhall meetings, targeted employee surveys and our enterprise-wide listening program designed to expand opportunities for anonymous, real-time feedback between managers and employees. Key topics covered include our culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, learning and development, wellbeing and recognition. Based on employee feedback, action plans are implemented to address gaps or to further enhance employee satisfaction in alignment with our overall human capital strategy. 

Results from our most recent listening program concluded in June 2022 benefited from strong employee participation and highlighted that employees generally feel engaged and aligned with the Company&#8217;s priorities. In many areas, such as mental wellbeing, recognition and freedom of opinion, results trended more favorably against our 2021 engagement survey and at or above comparable industry benchmarks. The 2022 results reinforced that our culture is a differentiator and strengths identified last year in the areas of overall engagement, goal setting, management support, work environment and flexibility, and diversity and inclusion continue to trend positively. Areas for continuing improvement include career development opportunities and managing workload. We will continue to develop actions plans in areas for improvement and monitor our progress each year. 

Fostering Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

At Assurant, we believe diversity, equity and inclusion (&#8220;DE&#38;I&#8221;) fosters innovation and creates growth opportunities by strengthening employee engagement for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. We believe diverse teams and inclusive cultures perform better by improving our ability to respond to the changing global marketplace and social landscape. 

We are committed to gender, racial and ethnic diversity at all levels of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, women comprised 60% of our global workforce, 43% at the managerial levels, 18% at the Assurant Management Committee level and 31% of our Board; and 53% of our U.S. workforce, 44% at the managerial levels, 18% at the Assurant Management Committee level and 23% of our Board identified as racially or ethnically diverse. Four of the Company&#8217;s diverse directors held leadership roles, including the Board Chair and three committee chairs. 

We are committed to continuing to increase representation and engagement of underrepresented groups within Assurant. Assurant&#8217;s Executive Inclusion Council, chaired by our CEO and comprised of our Management Committee, provides leadership oversight, engagement and accountability throughout Assurant to foster greater DE&#38;I. Our Chief Administrative Officer has direct oversight and responsibility for our DE&#38;I strategy. Additionally, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is committed to including women and minority candidates in the pool of qualified candidates from which Board nominees are chosen and will continue to review its processes and procedures to ensure that diverse candidates are included. 

We recruit talent in diverse communities, including through strategic and educational partnerships that bring greater visibility and expertise. We continue to strengthen our recruiting and talent practices to identify and remove inherent biases that could influence outcomes, including ongoing enterprise-wide diversity training and diverse slate and interviewing requirements for all managerial and above job openings. We are focused on inclusion through global programming that spotlights the experiences of underrepresented groups. In 2022, we launched three Employee Resource Groups to provide forums for 

employees to raise topics that are important to underrepresented groups. To augment local initiatives, we sponsored an inaugural, enterprise-wide diversity and inclusion mentorship program. In the marketplace, we support social justice causes through the Assurant Foundation and we partner with nonprofit organizations to provide leadership development opportunities. In 2022, we expanded our employees&#8217; participation in targeted development programs for women and underrepresented groups including representation at various HACE (Hispanic Alliance for Career Enhancement), ELC (Executive Leadership Council) and LEAP (Leadership Acceleration Program) forums. 

Pay Equity 

Assurant is committed to pay equity. Our compensation practices and programs consider a variety of factors designed to set fair and equitable compensation levels. We take a holistic approach to evaluating and aligning roles with compensation levels based on job responsibilities, market competitiveness, geographical location, strategic importance of roles and other relevant factors. We periodically evaluate our compensation practices and for the last several years have engaged in a multi-step process to ensure that we are compensating equitably across employees performing similar job responsibilities. Results from our last review completed in 2022, which examined base pay for U.S. and U.K.-based employees, confirmed that we are fairly administering pay and see no evidence of systemic and material pay equity issues. We expect to continue to assess compensation practices annually and remain committed to remediate any significant pay disparities we may discover. We also continue to monitor and adjust market wages as necessary to ensure we provide competitive wages, consistent with our ongoing compensation practices. 

We remain committed to investing in our people through competitive rewards and development opportunities. In 2022, this included making targeted off-cycle adjustments to ensure alignment of pay with the market and continuing to reward high performers. We continued to invest in merit increases, allocating more funding to front-line employees in recognition of the disproportionate impact of the current challenging economic environment. We have advanced our commitment to pay transparency, particularly in North America, by providing employees with base salary ranges for their role and grade beginning in 2023. 

Total Rewards and Wellbeing 

We are committed to the health and safety of our employees as we believe the success of our business is directly connected to their wellbeing. In addition to providing robust compensation and benefits programs and opportunities to invest in their financial future, we offer employees and their families access to a variety of health and wellness programs. Our Total Rewards programs help to provide protection and security related to events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial wellbeing, such as paid time off, family leave, family care resources and flexible work schedules. Our Global Employee Assistance Plan provides additional support to help employees and their families access critical resources for their wellbeing, including financial, physical and mental health. 

We regularly benchmark our Total Rewards against companies of similar size and industries to ensure our offerings remain competitive and solicit employee feedback on the evolving needs of our workforce. In 2022, we conducted employee focus groups that helped validate that recommended plan changes for 2023 met the needs of our diverse workforce particularly around predictability and affordability of health care costs. We will continue to assess additional opportunities across Total Rewards and Wellbeing to help attract and retain top talent. 

Recognizing the benefit of flexible work arrangements for our business, customers and employees, in 2022, we enabled a long-term shift to a hybrid work model to support our business and talent strategy. A majority of our employees now work virtually on a full-time or part-time basis and while we will continue to encourage purposeful in-person engagement to support our culture, team development and product innovation, we believe our hybrid work model will remain a key competitive advantage to support the evolving needs of our customers and employees. Within this hybrid environment, we introduced a new framework to support enterprise engagement. We accelerated our ongoing real estate consolidation to support work-from-home arrangements given our increasingly hybrid workforce, while making necessary investments in key facilities and markets to support the long-term strategy of the Company. 

Learning and Development 

Learning and development are essential to Assurant&#8217;s success. We continually invest in our employees&#8217; career growth and provide employees with a wide range of training and development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual and self-directed learning, mentoring and external development opportunities. We delivered live-virtual training to support the initial rollout of our redefined culture tenets which will continue as we further embed into our talent practices around key areas such as recruiting, performance management and recognition. Strengthening employees&#8217; leadership, technical and professional skills to broaden career opportunities, while also reinforcing a culture of strong ethics and compliance, are primary focus areas. In 2022, we implemented key initiatives to increase adoption of new technology and processes providing both learning tools and change support, furthering our focus on a digital-first mindset. Assurant also assists employees in the pursuit of undergraduate and graduate degrees, certifications and continuing education required by certain professional organizations. 

We have adapted our learning and development programs and delivery modes to meet the varying needs of our business and our predominantly virtual workforce. We provide a broad array of training on topics such as managing virtual and hybrid teams, mental health awareness and building resilience, managerial skills, and diversity and inclusion. 

Succession Planning 

An important element of our talent strategy is succession planning and building diverse leadership pipelines for our most critical roles across the organization. 

We assess the performance and potential of current incumbents, identify and assess potential successors, and create targeted development plans to strengthen the preparedness and diversity of our talent pipeline. Annually, we conduct a comprehensive talent review to discuss potential successors of our Management Committee and other key leadership roles. In 2022, we extended this to a broader group of top talent as we look to ensure better visibility into our strengths and opportunities for prioritized roles. The Board and the Nominating Committee annually review the CEO succession plan and succession plans for senior executives, which includes emergency successors for each role, with the goal to ensure we have the right leadership in place to execute the Company&#8217;s long-term strategic plans.

Ratings &#160; 

Independent rating organizations periodically review the financial strength of insurers, including many of our insurance subsidiaries. Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and contract holders. These ratings are not applicable to our common stock or debt securities. Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. 

Rating agencies also use an &#8220;outlook statement&#8221; of &#8220;positive,&#8221; &#8220;stable,&#8221; &#8220;negative&#8221; or &#8220;developing&#8221; to indicate a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A rating may have a stable outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however, a stable outlook does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time, without notice. 

Most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best Company (&#8220;A.M. Best&#8221;). In addition, three of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries are rated by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. (&#8220;Moody&#8217;s&#8221;) and S&#38;P Global Ratings, a division of S&#38;P Global Inc. (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;). The ratings issued on our operating insurance subsidiaries by these agencies are announced publicly and are available from the agencies. 

For information on the risks associated with ratings downgrades, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; A decline in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. &#8221; 

The following table summarizes the financial strength ratings and outlooks of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022: 

##TABLE_START A.M. Best (1) Moody&#8217;s (2) S&#38;P (3) Company American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida A A2 A American Bankers Life Assurance Company of Florida A A2 A American Security Insurance Company A A2 A Caribbean American Life Assurance Company A N/A N/A Caribbean American Property Insurance Company A N/A N/A Reliable Lloyds Insurance Company A N/A N/A Standard Guaranty Insurance Company A N/A N/A Virginia Surety Company, Inc. A N/A N/A Voyager Indemnity Insurance Company A N/A N/A ##TABLE_END

(1) A.M. Best financial strength ratings range from &#8220;A++&#8221; (superior) to &#8220;D&#8221; (poor). Ratings of A fall under the &#8220;excellent&#8221; category, which is the second highest of A.M. Best&#8217;s seven ratings categories. A.M. Best has a stable outlook on American Bankers Life Assurance Company of Florida and Caribbean American Life Assurance Company and a positive outlook on all of our other domestic operating insurance subsidiaries&#8217; financial strength ratings. 

(2) Moody&#8217;s insurance financial strength ratings range from &#8220;Aaa&#8221; (highest quality) to &#8220;C&#8221; (lowest rated). A numeric modifier may be appended to ratings from &#8220;Aa&#8221; to &#8220;Caa&#8221; to indicate relative position within a category, with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. A rating of A2 is considered &#8220;upper-medium-grade&#8221; and falls within the third highest of Moody&#8217;s nine ratings categories. Moody's has a stable outlook on all of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries&#8217; insurance financial strength ratings. 

(3) S&#38;P&#8217;s insurer financial strength ratings range from &#8220;AAA&#8221; (extremely strong) to &#8220;D&#8221; (general default). A &#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;-&#8221; may be appended to ratings from categories AA to CCC to indicate relative position within a category. Ratings of A (strong) are within the third highest of S&#38;P&#8217;s nine ratings categories. S&#38;P has a stable outlook on all of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries&#8217; insurer financial strength ratings. 

Regulation 

We are subject to extensive federal, state and international regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 

The following is a summary of significant regulations that apply to our businesses, but is not intended to be a comprehensive review of every regulation to which we are subject. For information on the risks associated with regulations applicable to us, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Business, Strategic and Operational Risks&#8221;, &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Legal and Regulatory Risks.&#8221; 

Holding Company Insurance Regulations 

Under applicable insurance holding company regulations, no person may acquire a controlling interest in the Company or any of our insurance company subsidiaries, unless such person has obtained prior regulatory approval for such acquisition. Under these laws, &#8220;control&#8221; is presumed when any person acquires or holds, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our common stock or of the voting securities of any of our insurance company subsidiaries. To obtain approval, the proposed acquiror must file an application with the relevant regulator. For more information on the risks associated with holding company insurance regulations, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; General Risk Factors &#8211; Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. &#8221; 

U.S. Insurance Regulation 

We are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states and territories where our insurance companies are domiciled. These laws generally require insurance companies within the insurance holding company system to register with the insurance departments of their respective states and territories of domicile and furnish reports to such insurance departments regarding capital structure, ownership, financial condition, risk management, corporate governance, general business operations and intercompany transactions. These laws also require that transactions between affiliated companies be fair and equitable. In addition, certain intercompany transactions, changes of control, certain dividend payments and certain transfers of assets between the companies within the holding company system are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, regulatory authorities in such states and territories. 

We are licensed to sell insurance through our insurance subsidiaries in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Like all U.S. insurance companies, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions where they do business. In general, these regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of shareholders and other investors. To that end, the laws of the various jurisdictions establish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such things as: 

&#8226; licensing; 

&#8226; capital, surplus and dividends; 

&#8226; underwriting requirements and limitations (including, in some cases, minimum or target loss ratios); 

&#8226; entrance into and exit from markets; 

&#8226; introduction, cancellation and termination of certain coverages; 

&#8226; statutory accounting and annual statement disclosure requirements; 

&#8226; product types, policy forms and mandated insurance benefits; 

&#8226; premium rates; 

&#8226; fines, penalties and assessments; 

&#8226; claims practices, including occasional regulatory requirements to pay claims on terms other than those mandated by underlying policy contracts; 

&#8226; transactions between affiliates; 

&#8226; the form and content of disclosures to consumers; 

&#8226; the type, amounts and valuation of investments; 

&#8226; annual tests of solvency and reserve adequacy; 

&#8226; assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and the recovery of assessments through premium increases; and &#160; 

&#8226; market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents. 

Risk-Based Capital Requirements. In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the &#8220;NAIC&#8221;) has established certain risk-based capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) standards applicable to life, health and property and casualty insurers. RBC, which regulators use to assess the sufficiency of an insurer&#8217;s statutory capital, is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, expense, liability and reserve items. Factors are higher for items that the NAIC views as having greater underlying risk. The NAIC periodically reviews the RBC formula and changes to the formula could occur in the future. 

In December 2020, the NAIC adopted a group capital calculation tool using an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within the insurance holding company system, including non-U.S. entities. The goal is to provide U.S. regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all groups regardless of their structure in order to identify risks that may emanate from an insurer&#8217;s holding company system. The NAIC has stated that the calculation will be a regulatory tool and will not constitute a requirement or standard. State legislatures began adoption of the group capital calculation model regulations in 2021 and state adoption is expected to continue in 2023. 

Investment Regulation. Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations that govern the kind, quality and concentration of investments made by insurance companies. These regulations require diversification of insurance company investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories. 

Financial Reporting. Regulators closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies. Our insurance subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports with insurance regulators. Moreover, states and territories regulate the form and content of these statutory financial statements. 

Products and Coverage. Insurance regulators have broad authority to regulate many aspects of our products and services. Additionally, certain non-insurance products and services we offer, such as service contracts, may be regulated by regulatory bodies other than departments of insurance and may be subject to consumer protection laws. 

Pricing and Premium Rates. Nearly all states and territories have insurance laws requiring insurers to file price schedules and policy forms with the state&#8217;s or territory&#8217;s regulatory authority. In many cases, these price schedules and/or policy forms must be approved prior to use, and state and territory insurance departments have the power to disapprove increases or require decreases in the premium rates we charge. 

Market Conduct Regulation. Activities of insurers are highly regulated by state and territory insurance laws and regulations, that govern the form and content of disclosure to consumers, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State and territory regulatory authorities enforce compliance through periodic market conduct examinations. 

Guaranty Associations and Indemnity Funds. Most states and territories require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds, which are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies. These associations may levy assessments on member insurers. In some states and territories, member insurers can recover a portion of these assessments through premium tax offsets and/or policyholder surcharges. 

Insurance Regulatory Initiatives. The NAIC, state and territory regulators and professional organizations have considered and are considering various proposals that may alter or increase state and territory authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. For example, at their Spring 2021 meeting, the NAIC adopted the NAIC Real Property Lender-Placed Insurance Model Act (the &#8220;LPI Model Act&#8221;). The LPI Model Act governs the insurance that a mortgage servicer obtains when a borrower fails to obtain or maintain required insurance. In 2022, Rhode Island enacted legislation that mirrors the LPI Model Act. It is anticipated that several states will follow suit and introduce state-level legislation relating to lender-placed insurance during their 2023 legislative session. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Legal and Regulatory Risks &#8211; Changes in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth &#8221; for a discussion of the risks related to such initiatives. 

Federal Regulation 

Although our business in the United States is primarily regulated by the states, federal initiatives often have an impact on our business in a variety of ways. Impacted areas include financial services regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, 

including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Legal and Regulatory Risks &#8211; Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.&#8221; 

Employee Retirement Income Security Act. We are subject to regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;). ERISA places certain requirements on how we may administer employee benefit plans covered by ERISA. Among other things, regulations under ERISA set standards for certain notice and disclosure requirements and for claim processing and appeals. 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Certain of our activities are subject to the privacy requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, along with regulations adopted thereunder, generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal financial information is used and the opportunity to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of certain disclosures, if applicable. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act . Regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) address mortgage servicers&#8217; obligations to correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers; provide certain information requested by such borrowers; and provide protections to such borrowers in connection with Lender-placed Insurance. These requirements affect our operations because, in many instances, we administer such operations on behalf of our mortgage servicer clients. While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) does not have direct jurisdiction over insurance products, it is possible that additional regulations promulgated by the CFPB may extend its authority more broadly to cover these products and thereby affect us or our clients. 

Tax Reform . On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;TCJA&#8221;), which significantly amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, was enacted. Of particular interest to the Company was the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) introduced a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for corporations that report an average annual adjusted income of more than $1 billion for a period of three consecutive years and a 1% excise tax on corporate share repurchases, among other things. The overall impact of the IRA is uncertain due to the ambiguities in the application of certain provisions, the impact of future guidance, interpretations or rules issued by government agencies and potential court decisions interpreting the legislation. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Legal and Regulatory Risks &#8211; Changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.&#8221; 

&#160; International Regulation 

We are subject to regulation and supervision of our international operations in various jurisdictions. These regulations, which vary depending on the jurisdiction, include, among others, anti-corruption laws; solvency and market conduct regulations; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; and corporate, employment, intellectual property and investment laws and regulations. We operate in various jurisdictions, including Canada, the U.K., France, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Germany, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, China and Singapore, and, in several of these jurisdictions, our businesses are supervised by local regulatory authorities. 

In the past few years, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the &#8220;IAIS&#8221;) developed a model common framework for the supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (&#8220;IAIGs&#8221;), which includes group-wide supervisory oversight across national boundaries and the establishment of ongoing supervisory colleges (&#8220;ComFrame&#8221;). ComFrame applies to entities that meet the IAIS&#8217;s criteria for IAIGs and that are so designated by their group-wide supervisor. The NAIC previously adopted changes to the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act to allow state insurance regulators in the U.S. to be designated as group-wide supervisors for U.S.-based IAIGs. While we do not currently meet the criteria for IAIG designation, we are monitoring developments of reforms adopted by the IAIS as they influence NAIC activities, including those related to risk and group capital oversight. 

Securities and Corporate Governance Regulation &#160; 

As a company with publicly-traded securities, we are subject to certain legal and regulatory requirements applicable generally to public companies, including the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the New York Stock Exchange (the &#8220;NYSE&#8221;) relating to public reporting and disclosure, accounting and financial reporting, corporate governance and other matters. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries are subject to the corporate governance laws of our respective jurisdictions of incorporation or formation. 

Consumer Protection Laws 

Numerous federal, state and international consumer protection laws affect the Company. For example, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established the CFPB to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB&#8217;s jurisdiction generally exclude insurance businesses, the CFPB may take the position that it has the authority to regulate certain non-insurance consumer 

services we provide. In addition, new or amended international regulations relating to fair value and fair treatment relating to products and services for consumers are being further considered or proposed, depending on the jurisdiction. 

Anti-Corruption Regulation 

We are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;) regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials and prohibits bribes and similar practices. In addition, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act has wide applicability to certain activities that affect U.K. companies, their commercial activities in the U.K., and potentially that of their affiliates located outside of the U.K. Anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations continue to be implemented and/or enhanced across most of the jurisdictions in which we operate. 

Cybersecurity and Privacy Regulation 

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of the European Commission&#8217;s laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, such as the public disclosure of significant data breaches, privacy impact assessments, data portability and the appointment of data protection officers. Since the enactment of GDPR, other countries where we conduct business have or are in the process of enacting stricter data protections laws that model GDPR, including Brazil, China, Japan and India. 

At the state level, the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law has been enacted in multiple states, imposing an array of detailed security measures, reporting and attestation requirements on insurance companies. With respect to privacy rights, five states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia) have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that further increase privacy rights in a manner similar to the GDPR. The accelerated rate of adoption of privacy legislation by states poses challenges for businesses as implementation and compliance may necessitate modifications to businesses processes, technological infrastructure, security measures and customer-facing websites. 

Cybersecurity risks and incidents remain a focus for regulators. In March 2022, the SEC proposed rules to enhance disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting by public companies; and in November 2022, the New York Department of Financial Services proposed amendments to require substantial updates to companies&#8217; cybersecurity compliance programs. 

Environmental Regulation &#160; 

Because we own and operate real property, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws. Potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties is an inherent risk in property ownership and operation. Additionally, under the laws of several states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of the cleanup, which could have priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property. To the extent we hold a mortgage loan on any property subject to such a lien, our ability to foreclose on that property should the related loan be in default would be impaired. Further, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for the costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at properties securing mortgage loans held by us. 

Other Regulation 

As we continue to grow and evolve our business mix to cover other non-insurance-based products and services, we have and will continue to become subject to other legal and regulatory requirements, including regulations of the CFPB and other federal, state and municipal regulatory bodies, as well as additional regulatory bodies in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Examples include U.S. and local customs and trade regulations for the movement of mobile devices across geographic borders; health, safety, labor and environmental regulations, including those impacting our mobile supply chain operations; U.S. and international laws and regulations broadly relating to the performance, transparency and reporting of environmental, social and governance matters, including the SEC&#8217;s proposed rules to enhance climate-related disclosures, including greenhouse gas emissions, governance of climate-related risks and climate-related financial statement metrics; and antitrust and competition-related laws and regulations that may impact future transactions or business practices. 

Global Risk Management 

Governance 

We employ a risk governance structure, overseen by our Board and senior management and coordinated by the Global Risk Management function, to provide a common framework for evaluating the risks embedded in and across our businesses and functional areas, developing risk appetites, managing these risks, and identifying current and future risk challenges and opportunities. 

Global risk management is the responsibility of the Chief Strategy and Risk Officer, who leads the Global Risk Management function and reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and reports at least quarterly to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board and to the Board; and the Global Head of Risk, who reports directly to the Chief Strategy and Risk Officer. Our Enterprise Risk Management Policy, which outlines our risk management framework and establishes principles for its effectiveness, has been approved by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board, and is reviewed annually to align with the Company&#8217;s business operations and strategy as well as changes to applicable laws, regulations and industry standards. 

Our risk management framework cascades downwards into the enterprise through various management committees. Our risk governance structure is headed by the management-level Enterprise Risk Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Strategy and Risk Officer, the Chief Legal Officer, the Treasurer, Chief Internal Auditor, Global Ethics and Compliance Officer, and other members of the risk leadership team. The Enterprise Risk Committee reviews the most significant risks, the alignment to the risk appetite of the Company, and the mitigation and remediation plans that correspond to these risks. 

Board of Directors and Committee Oversight 

The Board, directly and through its committees as described below and in their charters, oversees our risk management policies and practices, including our risk appetite, and discusses risk-related issues at least quarterly. The Board reviews management&#8217;s assessment of the Company&#8217;s key enterprise risks and receives a risk management update from the Chief Strategy and Risk Officer annually and management&#8217;s strategy with respect to each risk. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee coordinates Board and committee oversight of the key risks. The Board and its committees receive updates from management on specific risks throughout the year, and each committee chair reports significant risk updates at least quarterly to the full Board so that the Board has the benefit of the committee&#8217;s specific areas of risk oversight. 

The Audit Committee reviews the Company&#8217;s policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management and coordinates with the Finance and Risk Committee with respect to Board oversight of risk management and global risk management activities. The Audit Committee also focuses on risks relating to financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, disclosures (including disclosure of the Company&#8217;s material risks within this Report), and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee receives reports at least quarterly from the Chief Internal Auditor and the Global Ethics and Compliance Officer. The Finance and Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility of the Global Risk Management function and corresponding risk activities, and receives risk management updates at least quarterly from the Chief Strategy and Risk Officer and the Global Head of Risk that include the identification, assessment, reporting and mitigation of existing and emerging key enterprise risks. The Finance and Risk Committee also focuses on risks relating to investments, capital management and catastrophe reinsurance. The Compensation Committee focuses on risks relating to executive retention and compensation plan design, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee focuses on risks relating to director and management succession. The Information Technology Committee is responsible for oversight of information technology risk assessment and risk management. This includes oversight of cybersecurity policies, controls and procedures, such as procedures to identify and assess internal and external cybersecurity risks. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Board and each committee has the authority to retain external advisors. 

Management Oversight 

Global Risk Management is headed by our Global Head of Risk. Global Risk Management develops risk assessment and risk management policies, and facilitates the identification and assessment, monitoring and reporting, and mitigation of risks. 

The Company uses the three lines of defense operating model to provide structure around risk management and internal controls. The first line of defense is comprised of the business and functional areas that are responsible for the day-to-day management of Company&#8217;s business operations and related risks. The second line of defense provides independent oversight of risk-taking activities in the first line and is comprised of the Company&#8217;s Global Risk Management function and other enterprise staff control functions. The second line of defense assists in determining the risk appetite, strategies, policies and structure for managing risk, including business resiliency and operational risk. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and is independently governed by the Audit Committee. Internal Audit evaluates the adequacy of compliance with policies, procedures and processes established in the first and second lines, and assesses the design and ongoing effectiveness of risk management and the risk management framework. 

Risk Appetite, Identification and Assessment, Monitoring and Reporting, and Mitigation 

Risk appetite is defined as the levels, types and amount of risk that the Company is willing to accept to in the pursuit of its business and strategic objectives, consistent with prudent management of risk concomitant with available levels of capital. Global Risk Management, in conjunction with various management committees, develops recommendations for risk limits as part of our risk appetite framework. Using metrics as appropriate in establishing these risk limits allows for a cohesive 

assessment of risk, resources and strategy, and supports management and the Board in making well-informed business decisions. 

Risk identification and assessment, which involve the identification of risks, information gathering and analyses, are performed by Global Risk Management and conducted in coordination with the second and third lines of defense. Global Risk Management measures risk exposure, and monitors and manages internal and external risk reporting using a central risk depository as the single source for risk information. The register collects information obtained from the processes described above and other sources and is periodically reviewed and approved by the Enterprise Risk Committee. Risks are classified using an enterprise-wide risk taxonomy. Risk mitigation includes determining a course of action and monitoring progress against remediation.

For a more complete discussion of these risks, please see below. 

Business, Strategic and Operational Risks 

Our revenues and profits may decline if we are unable to maintain relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties face financial, reputational or regulatory issues . 

The success of our business depends largely on our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients, distributors and other parties, including vendors. Many of these arrangements are exclusive and some rely on preferred provider or similar relationships. If our key clients, distributors or other parties terminate important business arrangements with us, or renew contracts on terms less favorable to us, we may fail to meet our business objectives and targets, and our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

Each of our Global Lifestyle and Global Housing segments receives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few clients. A reduction in business with or the loss of one or more of our significant clients could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows of individual segments or the Company. Reliance on a few significant clients may weaken our bargaining power, and we may be unable to renew contracts with them without concessions (including up-front payments) or on favorable terms or at all. Examples of important business arrangements include, at Global Lifestyle, exclusive and non-exclusive relationships with mobile device carriers, retailers, dealerships and agents, MSOs, OEMs, consumer electronics retailers, appliance retailers (including e-commerce retailers), and financial, insurance and other institutions through which we distribute our products and services. At Global Housing, we have exclusive and non-exclusive relationships with mortgage lenders and servicers, manufactured housing lenders, property managers, and financial, insurance and other institutions. 

We are subject to the risk that clients, distributors and other parties may face financial difficulties (including as a result of macroeconomic challenges), reputational issues, problems with respect to their own products and services, or regulatory restrictions or compliance issues that may lead to lower than expected or cessation of sales of our products and services and have other adverse impacts on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our clients and other parties with whom we do business may change their strategic priorities or initiatives, including exiting or deprioritizing products, services, programs, distribution channels or lines of business that we service or support, or they may disintermediate us by developing internal capabilities, products or services that would allow them to service their clients without our involvement, which could materially reduce our revenues and profits. Furthermore, if one or more of our clients or distributors, for example in the wireless, automotive or mortgage servicing markets, consolidate or align themselves with other companies with whom we do not do business, they may choose to utilize or distribute the products and services of our competitors, which could materially reduce our revenues and profits. 

Significant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations . 

We compete for business, customers, agents and other distribution relationships with many insurance companies, financial services companies, mobile device repair and logistics companies, technology and software companies and specialized 

competitors that focus on one market, product or service. Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products and services than we do or be better able to tailor those products and services to customer needs, including through better technology systems or infrastructure, or may have greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower costs, greater financial strength, more resources or higher ratings. 

There is a risk that purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms and offerings from competitors, vendors or other third parties, including pricing and technology. Additionally, customers may turn to our competitors as a result of our or our client&#8217;s failure, or perceived failure, to deliver on customer expectations, product or service flaws, technology issues, gaps in operational support or other issues affecting customer experience. As a result, competition may adversely affect the persistency of our policies, our ability to sell products and provide services, maintain client relationships, and our revenues and results of operations. 

To remain competitive in many of our businesses, we must anticipate and respond effectively to changes in customer preferences, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, and disruptive technology developments and alternate business models. The evolving nature of consumer needs and preferences and improvements in technology could result in a reduction in consumer demand and in the prices of the products and services we offer. In addition, across many of our businesses, we must respond to the threat of disruption by traditional players, such as insurers, as well as from new entrants, such as &#8220;Insurtech&#8221; start-up companies and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation to simplify and improve the customer experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the markets in which we operate. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new technologies and new ways to deliver our products and services. If we do not anticipate and respond to customer preferences and disruptive changes, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 

The success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce . 

Our strategy is focused on delivering long-term profitable growth. As part of our strategy, we are developing new and innovative products and services, and enhancing existing offerings. We are investing in technology and other capabilities to continuously improve the customer experience, while seeking to increase efficiencies. We will continue to incur expenses related to, among other things: investments in digital capabilities and large-scale, critical programs, such as information technology and global financial systems and infrastructure; research and development of new products and capabilities; scaling our global operations, including accessing the global labor market; and costs associated with the implementation of new contracts and businesses in runoff, including sharing economy and small commercial, and improvements in operational efficiency. In December 2022, we announced restructuring initiatives that include realigning our organizational structure and talent to support our business strategy, which has resulted in severance and employee benefits charges, and accelerating ongoing real estate consolidation efforts to support work-from-home arrangements. Actual costs to implement these initiatives may exceed our estimates and we may not be able to fully realize our expected run rate savings and operational efficiency improvements. Our long-term strategy depends on successful operational execution and our ability to execute on our transformational initiatives, including acquisitions, combined with our ability to innovate and develop new products, achieve operating efficiencies and attract and retain a global and diverse workforce. See &#8220; &#8211; We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices, integrate acquired businesses or divest of non-strategic businesses effectively or identify new areas for organic growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations .&#8221; 

We rely on the continued service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce to achieve our long-term strategy. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to attract, recruit, motivate, develop and retain a high-performing workforce, particularly those with specialized industry knowledge or within critical or in-demand areas such as sales, digital, customer experience, data and analytics, and supply chain, across our lines of businesses. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions; employee expectations; the effectiveness of our talent strategies and total rewards and wellbeing programs, including compensation; and fluctuations in the labor market, including rising wages and competition for talent, which has increased due to persistent labor shortages and wage inflation. In addition, the global talent market and shift to remote or hybrid work arrangements at many companies, including us, have significantly increased competition for highly-skilled personnel, who are no longer limited to opportunities within a particular geographic area. A lack of employee engagement, including as a result of working remotely, may reduce efficiency and productivity; increase turnover, burnout and absenteeism; cause product development delays and hamper new product innovation; and otherwise adversely affect our business and impede the achievement of our strategy. We rely on attracting and retaining talent, including at the executive level, with diverse backgrounds and experiences to effectively oversee our businesses and our long-term strategy. If we do not succeed in attracting, retaining and motivating key personnel, including diverse personnel, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for and successfully carry out the succession of our key executives and senior leaders. 

We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices, integrate acquired businesses or divest of non-strategic businesses effectively or identify new areas for organic growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new venture opportunities, or to finance or complete transactions on acceptable terms. Additionally, the integration of acquired businesses and divestiture of non-strategic businesses may result in significant challenges and additional costs, and we may be unable to accomplish such transactions smoothly or successfully. 

Acquisitions and divestitures of non-strategic businesses may not provide us with the benefits that we anticipate, require significant effort and expenditures, and entail numerous risks, difficulties and uncertainties. These include, among others, diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources to the integration of operations and infrastructure, which could otherwise have been devoted to other strategic opportunities; inaccurate assessment of risks and liabilities; difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings, including the incurrence of unexpected integration or divestiture costs; difficulties in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; exposure to jurisdictions or businesses with heightened legal and regulatory risks, including corruption, which may increase compliance costs; difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including cybersecurity and other technology systems, and internal control over financial reporting; difficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures; failure to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows, business opportunities and growth prospects; an increase in our indebtedness or future borrowing costs; and limitations on our ability to access additional capital when needed. Our failure to adequately address these and other transaction risks, difficulties and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

The market price of our stock may decline if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses or divest of non-strategic businesses successfully, if the integration or divestiture takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, or if the effect of the business combination on the financial results of the combined company or the divestiture on the financial results of the standalone company is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors. 

Our ability to effectively identify and capitalize on opportunities for organic growth depends on, among other things, our ability to: deliver on customer expectations and provide a positive customer experience; successfully execute large-scale, critical programs and projects in a timely and cost-effective manner; identify and successfully enter and market our services in new geographic markets and market segments; recruit and retain qualified personnel; coordinate our efforts across various geographic markets and market segments; maintain and grow relationships with our existing customers and expand our customer base; offer new products and services; form strategic alliances and partnerships; secure key vendor and distributor relationships; and access sufficient capital. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing on our organic growth initiatives or that those initiatives will provide us with the expected benefits. Our failure to effectively identify and capitalize on opportunities for organic growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See &#8220; &#8211; The success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce. &#8221; 

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a business continuity event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we experience a business continuity event, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications outage or other systems failure, or other disaster, our ability to continue operations will depend on an effective business continuity and disaster recovery plan, including the safety and continued availability of our personnel, vendors and other third parties and facilities, and the proper functioning of our telecommunications and other systems and operations. An extended period of such conditions may strain our business continuity and disaster recovery plan, introduce additional operational risk, including cybersecurity and fraud risks, and negatively impact employee morale, and our inability to successfully recover from a business continuity event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have from time to time experienced business continuity events, including events that impacted the availability of our systems and the COVID-19 pandemic that impacted various aspects of our operations such as the safety and continued availability of our personnel. See &#8220; &#8211; &#160; Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks &#8211; The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information technology systems and infrastructure and integrate those of acquired businesses could adversely affect our business .&#8221; 

Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage and interruption. If a business continuity event occurs, we could lose Company, customer, vendor and other third-party data, lose significant processing capability or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of products and services to our clients and their customers, which has occurred from time to time and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A cyber attack or other business continuity event affecting us or key third parties with whom we work could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems 

or operations, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. An extended outage could result in the loss of income and clients, negative publicity and reputational damage, substantial volatility in our financial results and a decline in our revenues. See &#8220; &#8211; &#160; Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks &#8211; We could incur significant liability if our information technology systems or those of third parties are breached or we or third parties otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our respective systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations .&#8221; 

The risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas across the world, including the cities in which our device care centers, data centers and operations personnel are located; major metropolitan centers, such as Atlanta, where our headquarters is located; and certain catastrophe-prone areas, such as Miami, Florida, where we have significant operations. This risk is heightened in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to higher potential threat of terrorist attacks, military conflicts, political instability and data breaches. 

A disaster or other business continuity event on a significant scale or affecting our key businesses or our data centers, or our inability to successfully and quickly recover from such an event and any legislative and regulatory responses thereto, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, loss of customers or damaged customer relationships, legal liability and other adverse consequences. Our liability insurance policies may not fully cover, in type or amount, the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption. 

Failure to successfully manage vendors and other third parties could adversely affect our business. 

As we continue to improve operating efficiencies, we rely on vendors and other third parties, including independent contractors, to conduct business and provide services to our clients. For example, we use vendors and other third parties for business, investment management, information technology, operations, facilities management and other services. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of vendors and other third parties, including in our agreements with such parties, but our oversight controls could prove inadequate. Since we do not fully control the actions of vendors and other third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations adversely impact us and replacing them could create significant delay and expense. If these vendors or other third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements in a high-quality and timely manner, our operations and reputation could be compromised, we may not realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from these arrangements, and we could suffer adverse legal, regulatory and financial consequences. In addition, these third parties face their own technology, operating, business and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee or Company information or failure to comply with applicable law, could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients or employees, damage to our reputation and harm to our business. If we are unable to attract and retain relationships with qualified vendors, independent contractors and other third-party service providers, or if changes in law or judicial decisions require independent contractors to be classified as employees, our business could be significantly adversely affected. 

To the extent we engage international vendors or third parties to provide services or carry out business functions, we are exposed to the risks that accompany operations in a foreign jurisdiction, including international economic and political conditions, foreign laws and regulations, fluctuations in currency values and, potentially, increased risk of data breaches. For more information on the risks associated with the use of international vendors and third parties, see &#8220; &#8211; We face risks associated with our international operations. &#8221; 

We face risks associated with our international operations. 

Our international operations face economic, political, legal, compliance, regulatory, operational, supply chain and other risks. For example, we face the risk of restrictions on currency conversion and the repatriation of non-U.S. investments and earnings; burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and the associated risk and costs of non-compliance; exposure to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, which may result in unpredictable or inconsistent application of laws and regulations; exposure to commercial, political, legal or regulatory corruption; political, economic or other instability in countries in which we conduct business, including possible terrorist acts; the imposition of sanctions, tariffs, trade barriers or other protectionist laws or business practices that favor local competition, increase costs and may otherwise adversely affect our business; inflation and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; diminished ability to enforce our contractual rights; potential increased risk of data breaches; differences in cultural environments; changes in regulatory requirements, including changes in regulatory treatment of certain products or services; exposure to local economic conditions and its impact on our clients&#8217; performance and creditworthiness; and a competitive global labor market. 

If our business model is not successful in a particular country or region, or a country or region in which we do business experiences economic, political or other instability, we may lose all or part of our investment in that country or region. As we 

continue to scale our global operations, our business becomes increasingly exposed to these and other risks, in particular where certain countries or regions have recently experienced economic or political instability, such as in Argentina and Brazil. 

As we engage with international clients, we may make certain up-front commission payments or similar cash outlays, which we may not recover if the business does not develop as we expect. These up-front payments are typically supported by various protections, such as letters of credit, letters of guarantee and real estate, but we may not fully or timely recover amounts owed to us as a result of difficulties in enforcing contracts or judgments in undeveloped or evolving legal systems and other factors. In addition, we rely on fronting carriers in certain countries to maintain their licenses and product approvals, satisfy local regulatory requirements and continue in business. If they fail to do so, our business, reputation, and relationships with our clients and their customers could be adversely affected. 

For additional information on the significant international regulations that apply to us, including data protection regulations, and the risks relating thereto, see &#8220;Item 1 &#8211; &#160; Business &#8211; &#160; Regulation &#8211; &#160; International Regulation&#8221; in this Report, &#8220; &#8211; &#160; Legal and Regulatory Risks &#8211; We are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business, and violations or alleged violations of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations, &#8221; &#8220; &#8211; &#160; Legal and Regulatory Risks &#8211; Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions &#8221; and &#8220; &#8211; Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks &#8211; The costs of complying with, or our failure to comply with, U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and reputation. &#8221; 

Our mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices in our inventory, and to export compliance and other risks . 

The value of the mobile devices that we collect and refurbish for our clients may fall below the prices we have paid or guaranteed, which could adversely affect our profitability. In our mobile business, we carry inventory to meet the delivery requirements of certain clients. These devices are ultimately disposed of through sales to third parties. In addition, our inventory includes devices and parts on consignment with our nationwide network of nearly 500 Cell Phone Repair locations for in-store repairs. Our mobile business is subject to the risk that the value, including selling price, or availability of devices and parts will be adversely affected by: technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the devices and parts; physical problems resulting from faulty design or manufacturing; increased competition; decreased customer demand, including due to changes in customer preferences, changes in client promotions and seasonality; supply chain constraints; and growing industry emphasis on cost containment. The value and availability of devices may also be impacted by adverse foreign trade relationships and an escalation of U.S.-China and China-Taiwan trade tensions, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government relations, tariffs and other trade restrictions. If the value or availability of devices or parts is significantly reduced, it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. 

Our sales of mobile devices to third parties domiciled outside of the U.S. subject us to compliance risks relating to export control laws and regulations, which may adversely impact our ability to find buyers. Furthermore, certain businesses we acquire may violate, and from time to time have violated, such laws and regulations, which could subject us to liability. Non-compliance with such laws could adversely affect our business, reputation, relationships with our clients and their customers, financial condition and results of operations. See &#8220; &#8211; We face risks associated with our international operations &#8221; and &#8220; &#8211; Significant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations. &#8221; 

Sales of our products and services may decline if we are unable to develop and maintain distribution sources or attract and retain sales representatives and executives with key client relationships. 

We distribute many of our insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels, including mobile carriers, financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, association groups, other third-party marketing organizations and, to a limited extent, our own captives and affiliated agents. Our relationships with these distributors are significant for our revenues and profits. There is intense competition for distribution outlets. Agents who distribute our products are typically not exclusively dedicated to us, but also market the products of our competitors. In some cases, such agents may be affiliated with other insurers who may choose to write the product that such agents are now selling on our behalf. 

We have our own sales representatives. We depend in large part on our sales representatives and segment executives to develop and maintain client relationships. Our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives and executives with key client relationships could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

We face risks associated with joint ventures, franchises and investments in which we share ownership or management with third parties. 

From time to time, we have and may continue to enter into joint ventures and franchises and invest in entities in which we share ownership or management with third parties. In certain circumstances, we may not have complete control over governance, financial reporting, operations, legal and regulatory compliance or other matters relating to such joint ventures, 

franchises or entities. As a result, we may face certain operating, financial, legal and regulatory compliance and other risks relating to these joint ventures, franchises and entities, including risks related to the financial strength of joint venture partners, franchisees and other investors; the willingness of joint venture partners, franchisees and other investors to provide adequate funding for the joint venture, franchise or entity; differing goals, strategies, priorities or objectives between us and joint venture partners, franchisees or other investors; our inability to unilaterally implement actions, policies or procedures with respect to the joint venture, franchise or entity that we believe are favorable; legal and regulatory compliance risks relating to actions of the joint venture, franchise, entity, joint venture partners, franchisees or other investors; the risk that the actions of joint venture partners, franchisees and other investors could damage our brand image and reputation; and the risk that we will be unable to resolve disputes with joint venture partners, franchisees or other investors. As a result, joint ventures, franchises and investments in which we share ownership or management subject us to risk and may contribute significantly less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flows. 

Catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses, including as a result of climate change and the current inflationary environment, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition . 

Our insurance operations expose us to claims arising from catastrophes and non-catastrophes, particularly in our homeowners insurance, renters insurance and flood offerings, as well as in certain businesses the Company is exiting, including the sharing economy and commercial liability businesses. Catastrophes include hurricanes, windstorms, tornados, earthquakes, hailstorms, floods, severe winter weather, wildfires, epidemics and pandemics, terrorist attacks and accidents, and may result in reportable catastrophe losses, which are individual catastrophe events that generate losses in excess of $5.0 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. Non-catastrophe losses include losses from isolated fire, water and wind damage, theft and vandalism, as well as general liability in renters and homeowners policies, and losses from the sharing economy and small commercial businesses. Losses are impacted by increases in inflation and supply chain disruptions that increase the cost of materials and labor required to settle claims. In addition, non-catastrophe losses related to the sharing economy and small commercial businesses in particular have been, and may continue to be, impacted by increased claim settlement and loss adjustment expenses. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses that materially reduce our profitability and impact our available capital, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Changing weather patterns and climate change have increased the unpredictability, frequency and severity of weather-related events, such as wildfires, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes, particularly in coastal areas, and may result in increased claims and higher catastrophe losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Regulation in the area of climate change is increasing and we cannot predict how legal, regulatory, political and social responses to concerns around climate change may impact our business. While the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation have and may continue to increase the frequency and severity of claims from catastrophes. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions may have the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe losses, including by forcing expansion of certain insurance coverages for catastrophe claims, which may adversely impact our business. See &#8220; &#8211; Macroeconomic, Political and Global Market Risks &#8211; General economic, financial market and political conditions and conditions in the markets in which we operate may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. &#8221; 

Catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed our expectations. We use modeling tools that help estimate our probable losses, but these projections are based on historical data and other assumptions that may differ materially from actual events, and their reliability and predictive value may decrease as a result of climate change. These modeling tools may not be able to anticipate emerging trends or changing marketplace conditions. See &#8220; &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; Actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management. &#8221; 

We purchase reinsurance for certain risks, but if the severity of an event were sufficiently high, our losses could exceed our reinsurance coverage limits and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, recent availability and cost of reinsurance have been adversely impacted by market conditions. See &#8220; &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; Reinsurance may not be adequate or available to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. &#8221; In addition, claims from catastrophe and non-catastrophe events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations and financial condition for any particular fiscal quarter or year. 

Accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for catastrophe or non-catastrophe events before they occur. Once such an event occurs, the establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital. See &#8220; &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for 

claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital. &#8221; 

Because Global Housing&#8217;s lender-placed homeowners and lender-placed manufactured housing insurance products are designed to automatically provide property coverage for client portfolios, our exposure to certain catastrophe-prone locations, such as Florida, California, Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina, may increase. The withdrawal of other insurers from these or other states may lead to adverse selection and increased use of our products in these areas, and may negatively affect our loss experience and increase our costs. 

Negative publicity relating to our business, industry or clients may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 

We communicate with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers. From time to time, regulators, consumer advocacy groups and the media may focus their attention on our products and services, which may subject us to negative publicity. We may be negatively affected if another company in one of our industries or in a related industry, or if one of our clients, engages in practices that subject our industry or businesses to negative publicity. Negative publicity may result from judicial inquiries, unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits, social media, regulatory or governmental actions with respect to our products or services and industry commercial practices. For example, we may be subject to regulatory queries to assess practices in the insurance sector that potentially disadvantage people of color or historically underrepresented groups in certain insurance lines of business, or whether consumers have received fair value from our products and services. In addition, there is increased investor and regulatory focus on sustainability matters, including diversity, equity and inclusion, and commitment to long-term sustainability and efforts related to climate. A failure or perceived failure in our achievement of various sustainability initiatives and goals we may from time to time announce, or an actual or perceived increase in related risks as a result of our or our industry&#8217;s business activities, may subject us to negative publicity. 

Negative publicity may cause increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation or enforcement action by civil and criminal authorities. Additionally, negative publicity may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, constraining our ability to price our products appropriately for the risks we are assuming, requiring us to change the products and services we offer or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. 

Macroeconomic, Political and Global Market Risks 

General economic, financial market and political conditions and conditions in the markets in which we operate may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

Limited availability of credit, deteriorations of the global mortgage and real estate markets, declines in consumer confidence and consumer spending, including in Europe, increases in prices or in the rate of inflation, periods of high unemployment or labor shortages, persistently low or rapidly increasing interest rates, disruptive geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, China-Taiwan relations and supply chain disruptions, and other events outside of our control, such as a major epidemic or a pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, political or civil unrest, or the possibility of a U.S. government default on its debt obligations, could contribute, and in some cases have contributed, to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets, including the market for our stock, and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, during periods of economic downturn: 

&#8226; individuals and businesses may (i) choose not to purchase our insurance products, warranties and other products and services, (ii) terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse and (iii) choose to reduce the amount of coverage they purchase; 

&#8226; conditions in the markets in which we operate may deteriorate, impacting, among other things, consumer demand for the mobile devices, electronics, appliances, automobiles, housing and other products we insure, including the rate of introduction and success of new products, technologies and promotional programs that provide opportunities for growth; 

&#8226; clients are more likely to underperform expectations, experience financial distress and declare bankruptcy, which could have an adverse impact on the remittance of premiums from such clients and the collection of receivables from such clients for items such as unearned premiums and could otherwise expose us to credit risk; 

&#8226; claims on certain specialized insurance products tend to rise; 

&#8226; there is a risk of fraudulent insurance claims; 

&#8226; there may be an impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets and our investment portfolio may be adversely affected; 

&#8226; there may be fluctuations in the labor market and a negative impact on employee retention; 

&#8226; our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all may be negatively impacted; and 

&#8226; there may be substantial decreases in loan availability and origination, which may reduce the demand for credit insurance that we write or debt cancellation or debt deferment products that we administer. 

General inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, including within the current environment, has and may continue to increase the costs of paying claims, including for materials and labor, particularly in our Global Housing segment. In addition, inflationary pressures and shortages in the labor market have increased, and may continue to increase, our labor costs, including employee wages, and rising interest rates in response to rising inflation has impacted, and may continue to impact, our investment portfolio and capital. See &#8220; &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk, including changes in interest rates, that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. &#8221; Conversely, deflationary pressures may affect the pricing of our products and services. 

Financial Risks 

Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital . 

We maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported claims and incurred but not reported (&#8220;IBNR&#8221;) claims as of the end of each accounting period. Whether calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), Statutory Accounting Principles or accounting principles applicable in foreign jurisdictions, reserves are estimates. Reserving is inherently a matter of judgment and our ultimate liabilities could exceed reserves for a variety of reasons, including changes in macroeconomic factors (such as inflation, unemployment and interest rates), case development and other factors. From time to time, we adjust our reserves, and may adjust our reserving methodology, as these factors, our claims experience and estimates of future trends in claims frequency and severity change. In 2022, we have had $77.4 million of unfavorable loss development from our sharing economy and small commercial products, two lines of business that we expect to fully exit. Reserve development, changes in our reserving methodology and paid losses exceeding corresponding reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital. See &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; &#160; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; &#160; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; &#160; Reserves&#8221; in this Report for additional detail on our reserves. 

We may be unable to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, which could reduce our profitability. 

Our profitability could be reduced if we are unable to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, including the frequency and severity of property and other claims. This ability could be affected by various factors, including macroeconomic conditions, inflation, changes in the regulatory environment, changes in industry practices, changes in legal, social or environmental conditions, new technologies, or domestic and global supply chain and labor issues. In addition, modeling tools that support business decisions involve historical data and numerous assumptions that may differ materially from actual events. Climate change may make it more difficult to predict and model catastrophes, reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate risks. The inability to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, including costs related to climate change and macroeconomic conditions, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See &#8220; &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; Actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management. &#8221; 

A decline in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . 

Ratings are important considerations in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. A.M. Best rates most of our domestic and significant international operating insurance subsidiaries. Moody&#8217;s and S&#38;P rate three of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moody&#8217;s and S&#38;P, and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain them. Rating agencies may change their methodology or requirements for determining ratings, or they may become more conservative in assigning ratings. S&#38;P is expected to announce proposed changes to its rating methodologies for comment in first quarter 2023, the impact of which is uncertain at this time. Rating agencies could increase capital requirements for our subsidiaries or the enterprise, thereby reducing deployable capital at such subsidiary or at the holding company. Any reduction in these ratings could materially adversely affect our standing in the insurance industry and the demand for our products from intermediaries and consumers, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. 

As of December 31, 2022, our operations had a significant number of contracts that contain provisions that require the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum financial strength ratings, typically from A.M. Best, ranging from &#8220;A&#8221; or better to &#8220;B+&#8221; or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts or fail to renew them if the subsidiaries&#8217; ratings fall below these minimums. Termination of or failure to renew these agreements could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

A credit rating agency downgrade of our corporate senior debt rating could materially and adversely impact on our business. 

Currently, Assurant, Inc.&#8217;s senior debt is rated BBB by S&#38;P and Baa2 by Moody&#8217;s, and both ratings carry a stable outlook. 

If our senior debt credit ratings were downgraded, particularly if downgraded below investment grade, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and perceptions of our financial strength, could be materially and adversely affected. A downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to access liquidity quickly, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities, and increase the expense and difficulty of financing our operations, including temporary financing for subsidiaries necessary to address any immediate liquidity concerns, or refinancing our existing indebtedness on similar or more favorable terms. For example, the interest rate payable on certain series of our senior notes is subject to increase if either of S&#38;P or Moody&#8217;s downgrades the credit rating assigned to such series of senior notes to BB+ or below or to Ba1 or below, respectively. Additionally, we could be subject to more restrictive financial and operational covenants in any indebtedness we issue in the future, which could reduce our operational flexibility. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on our senior notes and the impact of rating changes. 

Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies may materially and adversely affect our results of operations . 

While most of our costs and revenues are in U.S. Dollars, some are in other currencies. Because our financial results in certain countries are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation, our results of operations, including period-over-period comparisons, have been and may continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. To a large extent, we do not currently hedge foreign currency risk. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against a local currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income. Similarly, our net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against a local currency. In 2022, we reported a $13.4 million unfavorable impact to net income due to foreign exchange-related losses. These fluctuations in currency exchange rates may result in losses that materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 

Additionally, we may incur foreign exchange losses in connection with the designation of the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency of our international subsidiaries. For example, management has classified Argentina&#8217;s economy as highly inflationary in accordance with GAAP accounting requirements and, as a result, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiaries was changed from the local currency to U.S. Dollars and their non-U.S. Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities were subject to remeasurement resulting in losses. We could incur additional losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations. For additional information on the change in functional currency for our Argentina subsidiaries and the effect thereof, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

An impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and book value. 

As a result of acquisitions, we have added a considerable amount of goodwill and other intangible assets to our balance sheet. Goodwill represented 62% of our total equity as of December 31, 2022. We review our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in our expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. In addition, other intangible assets collectively represented 15% of our total equity as of December 31, 2022. Estimated useful lives of finite intangible assets are reassessed on an annual basis. Generally, other intangible assets with finite lives are only tested for impairment if there are indicators of impairment identified, including a significant adverse change in the extent, manner or length of time in which the other intangible asset is being used or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the other intangible asset. 

An impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or significant reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and book value. For more information on our annual goodwill impairment testing, the goodwill of our segments and related reporting units and intangible asset impairment testing, see &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; &#160; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; &#160; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill&#8221; and Notes 2 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. 

As a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. While management has certified that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022, because internal control over financial reporting is complex, there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective 

in the future. We rely on manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error and internal control failure compared to automated processes. In second quarter 2022, we identified and disclosed certain accounting errors. Although we are in the process of implementing an integrated global financial system to, among other things, minimize our reliance on and use of manual processes, there can be no assurance that the implementation will be completed in a timely manner or on budget, or that it will achieve all of its intended goals. Any failure to implement required controls, or difficulties or errors encountered in their operation, including as a result of remote work arrangements, could adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could deteriorate investor confidence. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm would be unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or opine that our financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. Significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting may prevent us from reporting our financial information on a timely basis or cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to litigation and adverse regulatory consequences, including fines and other sanctions. If any of the foregoing were to occur, investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements could erode, resulting in a decline in our stock price, impairing our ability to raise capital, negatively affecting our reputation and subjecting us to legal and regulatory risk. 

Unfavorable conditions in the capital and credit markets may significantly and adversely affect our access to capital and our ability to pay our debts or expenses. 

The global capital and credit markets have experienced periods of uncertainty, volatility and disruption, including the possibility of a U.S. government default on its debt obligations, changes to U.S. and foreign tax and trade policies, imposition of new or increased tariffs, other trade restrictions, other government actions, foreign currency fluctuations and other factors. Our ability to raise money during such periods could be severely or entirely restricted. Our ability to borrow or raise money is important if our operating cash flow is insufficient to pay our expenses, meet capital requirements, repay debt, pay dividends on our common stock or make investments. As a holding company, we have limited direct operations of our own. The principal sources of our liquidity are dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, cash flow from our investment portfolio, the Credit Facility (as defined below) and liquid assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets include a variety of short-and long-term instruments. If our access to the capital and credit markets is restricted, our cost of capital could increase, thus decreasing our profitability and reducing our financial flexibility, including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar or more favorable terms. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially and adversely affected by periods of uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the capital or credit markets. 

Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk, including changes in interest rates, that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . 

Investment returns are an important part of our profitability. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, including in the fixed maturity and equity securities markets, which could impair our profitability, financial condition and cash flows. Further, in pricing our products and services, we incorporate assumptions regarding returns on our investments. Market conditions may not allow us to invest in assets with sufficiently high returns to meet our pricing assumptions and profit targets over the long term. 

We are subject to interest rate risk in our investment portfolio. Changes in interest rates have, and may continue to, materially adversely affect the performance of some of our investments, including by materially reducing the fair value of and investment income from fixed maturity securities and increasing unrealized losses in our investment portfolio, which can adversely impact our capital. As of December 31, 2022, fixed maturity securities represented approximately 84% of our total investments and full year 2022 gross investment income from fixed maturity securities totaled $270.0 million. The fair market value of fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases directly with fluctuations in interest rates. In addition, actual investment income and cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. 

Recent periods have been characterized by increasing interest rates. A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at high levels may result in greater unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. Conversely, a prolonged period during which interest rates are at lower levels may result in lower-than-expected investment income. Though we employ asset/liability management strategies to manage the adverse effects of interest rate changes, significant fluctuations may require us to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to pay claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See &#8220;Item 7A &#8211; &#160; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8211;Interest Rate Risk&#8221; in this Report. 

Our investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds, preferred stocks, leveraged loans, municipal bonds and commercial mortgages. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and result in realized investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by downgrades in the corporate bonds included in our portfolio, increases in treasury rates or credit spreads and by other factors that may result in realized and unrealized investment losses and other-than-temporary impairments. The determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary impairment requires the judgment of management and there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in facts, circumstances or critical assumptions could cause management to conclude that further impairments have occurred, which could lead to additional losses on investments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio. For further details on net investment losses, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

The value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of its issuer. As of December 31, 2022, fixed maturity securities represented approximately 84% and below investment grade securities (rated &#8220;BB&#8221; or lower by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) represented approximately 5% of our total investments. Below investment grade securities generally are expected to provide higher returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See &#8220;Item 7A &#8211; &#160; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#8211; &#160; Credit Risk&#8221; in this Report for additional information on the composition of our fixed maturity securities portfolio. 

Equity securities represented approximately 4% of our total investments as of December 31, 2022. However, we have had higher percentages of equity securities in the past and may make more equity investments in the future. Investments in equity securities generally are expected to provide higher total returns but present greater risk to preservation of capital than our fixed maturity securities. All changes in the fair value of equity securities are reported in our statements of operations, which has increased the volatility of our financial results. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information. 

Our investments in commercial mortgage loans on real estate (which represented approximately 4% of our total investments as of December 31, 2022) are relatively illiquid. If we require extremely large amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices and in a timely manner. 

The manner in which we allocate our resources across the portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest may increase credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

The value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

In accordance with applicable income tax guidance, we must determine whether our ability to realize the value of our deferred tax asset or to recognize certain tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221;. Under current income tax guidance, a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance, or a liability related to uncertain tax positions should be accrued, if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carry-forward periods. 

In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, management made certain judgments relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss and tax credit carry-forwards, levels of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The assumptions in making these judgments are updated periodically on the basis of current business conditions affecting us and overall economic conditions. These management judgments are therefore subject to change due to factors that include changes in our ability to realize sufficient taxable income of the same character in the same jurisdiction or in our ability to execute other tax planning strategies. Furthermore, any future changes in tax laws could impact the value of our deferred tax assets. Management will continue to assess and determine the need for, and the amount of, the valuation allowance in subsequent periods. Any change in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Reinsurance may not be adequate or available to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers . 

As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various operating segments. We also access the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (&#8220;FHCF&#8221;) to reinsure eligible Florida risks. Although reinsurers are liable to us for claims properly ceded under our reinsurance arrangements, we remain liable to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Ceded reinsurance arrangements therefore do not eliminate our obligation to 

pay claims. We are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. The inability to collect amounts due from reinsurers and any changes in the FHCF could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions, which have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely impacted by: the occurrence of significant reinsured events, including catastrophes, or expectations regarding increased occurrences of such events due to climate change; and other impacts on reinsurers&#8217; capital, such as increased demand for coverage driven by inflation, a volatile investment market or unforeseen litigation costs. Recently, premiums charged for reinsurance coverage increased significantly and we expect elevated pricing to continue through 2023. In the future, we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage for some of our businesses at commercially reasonable rates or at all. In such a situation, we might be adversely affected by state and other regulations that prohibit us from excluding catastrophe exposures or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe-prone areas. In addition, we may not be able to renew our current reinsurance facilities or obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts, at favorable rates and with favorable terms. The inability to obtain reinsurance at favorable rates or at all could cause us to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, take more risk, hold more capital or incur higher costs. Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

Through reinsurance, we have sold or exited businesses that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the reinsurers become insolvent . 

In the past, we have sold, and in the future we may sell, businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties. We have exited certain businesses through reinsurance. We have a reinsurance recoverable balance with John Hancock Life Insurance Company (&#8220;John Hancock&#8221;) of $436.5 million as of December 31, 2022, related to the sale of our Long-Term Care division through reinsurance. The A.M. Best rating of John Hancock is currently A+. Certain assets backing reserves reinsured under this sale and other sales are held in trusts or separate accounts. However, if the reinsurers became insolvent, the assets in the trusts or separate accounts could prove insufficient to support the liabilities that would revert to us and we may again become responsible for administering these businesses. We do not currently have the administrative systems and capabilities to process these businesses. We might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, other third parties to whom we have sold businesses in the past may in turn sell these businesses to other third parties, through reinsurance or otherwise, and we could face credit risks and risks related to the new administrative systems and capabilities of these third parties in administering these businesses. 

For more information on these arrangements, including the reinsurance recoverables and risk mitigation mechanisms used, see &#8220;Item 7A &#8211; &#160; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks &#8211; &#160; Credit Risk&#8221; in this Report. 

Due to the structure of our commission program, we are exposed to risks related to the creditworthiness and reporting systems of some of our agents, third-party administrators and clients. 

We are subject to the credit risk of some of the agents, third-party administrators and clients with which we contract in our businesses. We may incur losses related to accounts receivables, write-downs of upfront fees, write-downs of deferred acquisition costs, insurance reserves held by third parties without collateral, reimbursement of claims or commissions prepaid by us and loans granted to such counterparties. In addition, some of our agents, third-party administrators and clients collect and report premiums or pay claims on our behalf. These parties&#8217; failure to remit all premiums collected or to pay claims on our behalf on a timely and accurate basis could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Our subsidiaries&#8217; inability to pay us sufficient dividends could prevent us from meeting our obligations and paying future stockholder dividends . 

As a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, to repurchase shares or debt, to pay for certain expenses, to acquire new businesses, and to pay dividends to common stockholders. Our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay dividends and to make such other payments depends on their GAAP equity or statutory surplus, future earnings, cash position, rating agency requirements and regulatory restrictions, as applicable. Regulators could increase capital requirements for our subsidiaries, thereby reducing deployable capital at such subsidiary. Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries&#8217; creditors, including policyholders, have priority over our claims with respect to our subsidiaries&#8217; assets and earnings. If any of our subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against our subsidiaries&#8217; assets or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of our subsidiaries under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary and the insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. 

The payment of dividends by any of our regulated domestic insurance company subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary&#8217;s domiciliary jurisdiction department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by jurisdiction. The formula for the majority of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is based on the prior year&#8217;s statutory net income or 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year. Some jurisdictions have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, they may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. Future regulatory actions could further restrict our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay us dividends. For more information on the maximum amount of dividends our regulated U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us in 2022 under applicable laws and regulations, without prior regulatory approval, see &#8220;Item 5 &#8211; &#160; Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities &#8211; &#160; Dividend Policy.&#8221; 

Any additional material restrictions on our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay us dividends could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock, service our debt and pay other expenses. 

Our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited. 

Our declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock in the future will be determined by the Board in its sole discretion and will depend on various factors, including: our subsidiaries&#8217; payment of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial condition and capital requirements; general business conditions and growth prospects; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factor the Board deems relevant. The payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to the preferential rights of preferred stock that the Board may create from time to time. The Credit Facility contains limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders if we are in default, or such dividend payments would cause us to be in default, of our obligations thereunder. In addition, if we defer the payment of interest on our Subordinated Notes (as defined hereafter), we generally may not make payments on our capital stock. Furthermore, the agreements governing any of our or our subsidiaries&#8217; future indebtedness may limit our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock. In the event that any agreements governing any such indebtedness restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends in cash on our common stock, we may be unable to declare and pay dividends in cash on our common stock unless we can repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under such agreements. 

At any time when we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments on the Subordinated Notes, we generally may not make payments on our capital stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. 

Actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management. 

We use various modeling techniques and data analytics throughout the organization to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends, and other risks associated with our assets, liabilities, profitability and cash flows. This includes both proprietary and third-party modeled outputs and related analysis to assist us in decision-making related to pricing and rate filings, catastrophe and non-catastrophe modeling, loss reserving, asset management, corporate tax, financial reporting, and risk and capital management, among other things. The modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to uncertainties and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including model design errors; rely on numerous assumptions and the use of historical internal and industry data; and may lead to unintentional bias. In addition, climate change may make it more difficult to predict 

and model catastrophes, reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate risks. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. If, based upon these models, we misprice our products, underestimate the frequency or severity of catastrophes and non-catastrophe losses, or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. 

Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks 

The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information technology systems and infrastructure and integrate those of acquired businesses could adversely affect our business. 

The success of our business depends on our ability to maintain effective, secure and reliable information technology systems and infrastructure and to modernize them to support current and new clients and grow in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Some of the Company&#8217;s information technology systems and software are legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards, including business continuity procedures. We are undergoing a multiyear transformation of our information technology systems and infrastructure involving several enterprise-wide technology initiatives to support our strategy and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and evolving industry and regulatory requirements. This includes implementing an integrated global financial system; enhancing existing systems, procedures and controls; developing new systems and products; and retiring certain legacy systems. We have also migrated many of our systems and applications to the cloud, which is key to our technology strategy. We currently rely on significant manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error and internal control failure compared to automated processes, such as the accounting errors that were identified and disclosed in second quarter 2022. We must integrate the systems of acquired businesses effectively so that technology gained through acquisitions meets the required level of security and performance capabilities to avoid additional risk to existing operations. 

Our ability to modernize our information technology systems and infrastructure requires us to execute large-scale, complex programs and projects, which rely on the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources and effective planning and management processes. We may be unable to implement these programs and projects effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner, which could result in operational resiliency issues, poor customer experience, cost overruns, additional expenses, reputational harm, legal and regulatory actions, and other adverse consequences. 

If we are unable to maintain information technology systems, infrastructure, procedures (including technology continuity planning and recovery testing) and controls that function effectively without interruption and securely (including through a failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete hardware, applications or software systems), or to update or integrate our systems, we may not be able to service our clients and their customers, successfully offer our products, grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner, and our relationships with clients could be adversely affected. We are dependent on vendors and other third parties to maintain reliable network systems that provide adequate speed and data capacity. For example, we utilize third-party cloud service providers in connection with certain key aspects of our business and operations, including in the Global Automotive businesses and in implementing an integrated global financial system, and any disruption of, or interference with, our use of such cloud services could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. We have from time to time experienced operational resiliency issues, including the unavailability of information technology systems upon which our clients rely. Such failures could result in loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For risks relating to the security of our information technology systems and cyber attacks, see &#8220; &#8211; We could incur significant liability if our information technology systems or those of third parties are breached or we or third parties otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our respective systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. &#8221; 

We could incur significant liability if our information technology systems or those of third parties are breached or we or third parties otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our respective systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

We rely on the uninterrupted and secure operation of our information technology systems to operate our business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information. This electronic information includes confidential and other sensitive information, including personal data, that we receive from our customers, vendors and other third parties. Our information technology systems and safety control systems and those of our vendors and other third parties with whom we share sensitive information are vulnerable to, and in some cases have been subject to, damage or interruption from a variety of external threats, including cyber attacks, computer viruses, malware and ransomware, as well as targeted attacks against our employees, which recently have been increasing in frequency. 

Cyber attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations, organized crime, hackers and &#8220;hacktivists&#8221; (activist hackers), through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including long-term, persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats, attacks via yet unknown vulnerabilities referred to as zero-day threats and credential harvesting attacks against our 

employees. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, resulting in potential data loss or other damage to information technology systems. As the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use continue to grow, and as a result of the remote and hybrid work arrangements for a portion of our employees, the risk of security breaches and cyber attacks has increased. 

Our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees and third parties who may have otherwise legitimate access to our systems. Our call centers subject us to additional risk from internal threats due to access to personal data. Moreover, we face the ongoing challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment. Remote and hybrid work arrangements, including the use of personal devices and home networks that are not managed by the organization&#8217;s security control framework, bypass certain physical security controls for our employees and the employees of our vendors who have access to sensitive information. While additional technical controls have been put in place, they may not be sufficient to discover compromises that occur due to the loss of physical controls. The latency of a compromise is often measured in months but could be years, and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner. We could experience significant financial and reputational harm as a result of operational resiliency issues, including if our information technology systems are breached, sensitive client or Company data are compromised, surreptitiously modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public, or if we fail to make adequate disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event. 

Our data protection measures may not be effective to protect our network and systems from external and internal threats. Should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user or otherwise, we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data. Certain measures that could increase the security of our systems take significant time and resources to deploy broadly and may not be effective against an attack. Additionally, our policies, procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential, personal or proprietary information and other cybersecurity incidents, assess the severity or impact of any such incidents or appropriately respond in a timely manner. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade effective protective measures and other safeguards or adequately respond to a breach could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Although we continue to invest in security and engage in best practices for software development, code vulnerabilities may still be introduced into production environments. Our information technology systems must be continually patched and upgraded to protect against vulnerabilities, including zero-day threats, and we are at risk that cyber attackers exploit these vulnerabilities before they have been addressed. Due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate and the increased frequency with which vendors issue security patches to their products, the need to test patches and, in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors, before they can be deployed, we are at risk that we cannot deploy these patches in a timely and effective manner. We are dependent on vendors and other third parties, such as cloud service providers, to keep their systems patched in order to protect our data. We have vendors and other third parties who receive data from us in connection with the services we offer our customers. In addition, we have migrated certain data, and may increasingly migrate data, to the cloud hosted by third-party providers. We are at risk of a cyber attack involving a vendor or other third party, which could result in a breakdown of such third party&#8217;s data protection measures or access to our infrastructure through the third party. To the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a cyber attack that compromises their operations, our data and our customers&#8217; data could be compromised or we may experience service interruption. Any failure related to these activities and operational resiliency could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

The process of integrating the information technology systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk. For instance, we may not adequately identify weaknesses in an acquired entity&#8217;s information technology systems, either before or after the acquisition, which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition, expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyber attack. We may be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner, which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place. 

We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as malware incursions, distributed denial of service attacks, hardware misconfigurations, zero-day exploits, employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error, such as loss of portable and other data storage devices. Like many companies, we are subject to regular phishing email and social media engineering campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections and financial and data losses. Although some of these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages, to date, they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations. In the future, these types of incidents could result in confidential, restricted personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen, surreptitiously modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time, or maliciously made public, including client, employee or Company data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Improper access to or disclosure of sensitive client or Company information could harm our reputation and subject us to significant liability under our contracts, as well as under existing or future laws, rules and regulations. In the event of a cyber 

attack, we might have to take our systems offline, which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation. We may be unable to detect an incident, assess its severity or impact, or appropriately respond and recover any financial and data loss in a timely manner. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to mitigate the damage and to protect against future damage. In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber attacks and other related data and system incidents. 

The costs of complying with, or our failure to comply with, U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and reputation. 

In providing services and solutions to our customers and operating our business, we process, store and transfer sensitive customer, end-consumer and Company data, including personal data, in and across multiple jurisdictions. As a result, we are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. For discussion of the various laws and regulations affecting our business, see &#8220;Item 1 &#8211; Business &#8211; Regulation&#8221; in this Report. The scope and interpretation of these laws and additional laws that are or may be applicable to us are continuously evolving, often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time and may restrict the way services involving data are offered, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations. Complying with these and similar laws and regulations requires us to make significant changes to our operations, which rely on the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources and effective planning and management processes. We may be unable to implement required operational changes effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner, which could result in cost overruns, additional expenses, reputational harm, legal and regulatory actions and other adverse consequences. 

Unauthorized disclosure or transfer of personal or otherwise sensitive data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, misappropriation or other means, by us, our vendors or other parties with whom we do business could subject us to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution and other adverse consequences in one or more jurisdictions. Such events could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation and cause us to lose clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Legal and Regulatory Risks 

We are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business, and violations or alleged violations of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations. 

We are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the U.S. and its various states and territories, the E.U. and its member states, the U.K. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, trade sanctions, export control regulations and restrictions and anti-money laundering laws. We are subject to other laws and regulations on matters as diverse as antitrust, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, accounting standards implemented by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and accounting-related rules and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, environmental protection, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations. In addition, new or proposed environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, may result in expanded mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure. Furthermore, our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory oversight, including: restrictions and requirements related to licensing; capital, surplus and dividends; underwriting limitations; the ability to enter, exit and continue to operate in markets; statutory accounting and other disclosure requirements; the ability to provide, terminate or cancel certain coverages; premium rates, including regulatory ability to disapprove or reduce the premium rates companies may charge; trade and claims practices; product forms, including regulatory ability to disapprove new product filings; content of disclosures to consumers; type, amount and valuation of investments; assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and companies&#8217; ability to recover assessments through premium increases; and market conduct and sales practices. 

The U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and may change rapidly, and our efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources and increase the costs and risks of doing business in these jurisdictions. The regulations we are subject to have become more stringent over time, may decrease the need for our services, impose significant operational limits on our business and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Further, the laws and regulations affecting our business are subject to change as a result of, among other things, new interpretations and judicial decisions, and any such changes may increase the regulatory requirements imposed on us, impact the way we are able to do business, impact efforts to protect intellectual and other property, and significantly harm our business and results of operations. While we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we or our employees, consultants, contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to investigations, criminal penalties, civil remedies or other adverse consequences, including fines, injunctions, loss of 

an operating license or approval, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business, redress to clients, exposure to negative publicity or reputational damage and harm to client, employee and other relationships. Moreover, our failure to comply with laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may result in increased regulatory scrutiny by other regulatory agencies in that jurisdiction or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. The cost of compliance and the consequences of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional discussion of the various laws and regulations affecting our business, see &#8220;Item 1 &#8211; &#160; Business &#8211; &#160; Regulation&#8221; in this Report. 

Changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Federal, state or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, are subject to significant change and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, in 2017, the TCJA, which significantly amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, was enacted; and in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;), which introduced a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax applicable to corporations in certain situations and a 1% excise tax on corporate share repurchases, among other things, was enacted. Compliance with the TCJA and the IRA may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements, the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions and increase costs. The overall impact of the TCJA and the IRA is uncertain due to the ambiguities in the application of certain provisions, the impact of future guidance, interpretations or rules issued by government agencies and potential court decisions interpreting the legislation. Future changes in tax laws, including changes in the application or interpretation of the TCJA or the IRA, or increases to the corporate tax rate, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&#8217;s efforts around Global Pillars I and II dealing with possible new digital taxes and global minimum taxes, if implemented, could increase the Company&#8217;s overall tax burden, adversely impacting the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions . 

From time to time, we may be, and in certain cases have been, subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including: 

&#8226; industry-wide investigations regarding business practices, including the use and marketing of certain types of insurance policies or certificates of insurance, and compliance with guidance issued by regulators; 

&#8226; actions by regulatory authorities that may restrict our ability to increase or maintain our premium rates, require us to reduce premium rates, require us to allow customers to defer premium payments on certain of our products, make offering our products more expensive or unattractive to our clients, impose fines or penalties, and result in other expenses; 

&#8226; market conduct examinations, for which we are required to pay the expenses of the regulator as well as our own expenses, and which may result in fines, penalties, and other adverse consequences; 

&#8226; disputes regarding our Lender-placed Insurance products, including those relating to rates, agent compensation, consumer disclosure, continuous coverage requirements, loan tracking services and other services that we provide to mortgage servicers; 

&#8226; disputes over coverage or claims adjudication; 

&#8226; disputes over our treatment of claims, in which states or insureds may allege that we failed to make required payments or meet prescribed deadlines for adjudicating claims; 

&#8226; disputes regarding regulatory compliance, sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, underwriting and compensation arrangements; 

&#8226; disputes over liability claims under comprehensive general liability policies involving property damage or personal injury at insured properties or relating to insured vehicles; 

&#8226; disputes alleging bundling of credit insurance and warranty products with other products provided by financial institutions; 

&#8226; disputes with tax and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities; 

&#8226; investigations alleging violations of sanctions and/or export control laws; 

&#8226; disputes relating to customers&#8217; claims that they were not aware of the full cost or existence of the insurance or limitations on insurance coverage; and 

&#8226; employment litigation claims brought by current or former employees. 

Further, actions by certain regulators may cause additional changes to the structure of the Lender-placed Insurance industry, including the arrangements under which we track coverage on mortgaged properties. These changes could materially adversely affect the results of operations of Global Housing and the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. For additional information, see &#8220;Item 1 &#8211; Business &#8211; &#160; Regulation&#8221; in this Report. 

We are involved in a variety of litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our current and past business operations and may, from time to time, become involved in other such actions. We continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these proceedings. 

We participate in settlements on terms that we consider reasonable; however, the results of any pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and involve significant uncertainty. Unfavorable outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings or significant problems in our relationships with regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, reputation, ratings and ability to continue to do business. They could expose us to further investigations or litigation. In addition, certain of our clients in the mortgage, auto financing, credit card and banking industries are the subject of various regulatory investigations and litigation matters regarding mortgage lending practices, credit insurance, debt-deferment and debt cancellation products, and the sale of protection products, which could indirectly negatively affect our businesses.

Our business is subject to risks related to reductions in the insurance premium rates we charge. 

The premiums we charge are subject to review by regulators. If they consider our loss ratios to be too low, they could require us to reduce our rates. Significant rate reductions could materially reduce our profitability. 

We file rates with the state departments of insurance in the ordinary course of business. In addition to this routine correspondence, from time to time we engage in discussions and proceedings with certain state regulators regarding our Lender-placed Insurance business. The results of such reviews may vary. As previously disclosed, we have reached agreements with state insurance regulators in certain states, including New York, Florida, California, Indiana, Texas and Minnesota, regarding our Lender-placed Insurance business in those states. In addition, we completed a regulatory settlement agreement (the &#8220;RSA&#8221;) to resolve a targeted multistate market conduct examination sponsored by the NAIC and focused on Lender-placed Insurance, which includes a number of requirements and restrictions that are applicable in all participating states and U.S. territories. Among other things, the terms of the RSA require more frequent rate filings for Lender-placed Insurance. This could result in downward pressure on premium rates for these products. If such filings result in significant decreases in premium rates for our Lender-placed Insurance products, our cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 

Changes in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth . 

Legislation or other regulatory reform related to the insurance industry that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations. Various state and federal regulatory authorities have taken actions with respect to our Lender-placed Insurance business, including the multistate market conduct examination and related RSA. If we were unable for any reason to comply with any new or revised requirements, including the RSA, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, new interpretations of existing laws or new judicial decisions affecting the insurance industry could adversely affect our business. 

Insurance industry-related legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm our subsidiaries and us include: 

&#8226; imposed reductions in premium rates, limitations on the ability to raise premiums on existing policies, or new minimum loss ratios; 

&#8226; increases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; 

&#8226; enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future financial crises or to otherwise ensure the stability of institutions; 

&#8226; new licensing requirements; 

&#8226; restrictions on the ability to offer certain types of insurance products, service contracts or other protection products; 

&#8226; prohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk-sharing arrangements; 

&#8226; more stringent standards of review for claims denials or coverage determinations; 

&#8226; increased regulation relating to Lender-placed Insurance; and 

&#8226; new or enhanced regulatory requirements that require insurers to pay claims on terms other than those mandated by underlying policy contracts. 

In addition, regulators in certain states have hired third-party auditors to audit the unclaimed property records of insurance companies operating in those states. Among other companies, we are currently subject to these audits in a number of states and have been responding to information requests from these auditors. 

General Risk Factors 

Our common stock may be subject to stock price and trading volume volatility. 

Our common stock price and trading volume could materially fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: variations in our quarterly operating results, including against expectations; catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; changes in our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; financial strength ratings; changes in our corporate debt ratings; changes to our registered securities; limitations on premium levels or the ability to maintain or raise premiums on existing policies; regulatory developments affecting our products or services; and negative publicity relating to us or our competitors. In addition, macroeconomic, geopolitical conflicts and industry fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the trading price or volume of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. 

Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. 

Our ability to attract, recruit, hire, motivate, develop and retain employees and clients depends upon our corporate culture. Our employees are the cornerstone of our culture and acts of misconduct by any employee, and particularly by senior management, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation. Our employees could engage or be accused of engaging in misconduct that subjects us to litigation, regulatory sanctions, financial costs and serious harm to our reputation or financial position. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or determine, on the basis of such misconduct, that we have not established an adequate program to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective. Misconduct by employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, reputation and business. 

Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests . 

Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. For example, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors, which could delay, defer or prevent a change in control. Such provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts. 

Additionally, applicable state and foreign insurance laws may require prior approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer. State statutes generally provide, and certain foreign statutes provide, that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist when any person directly or indirectly owns, controls, has voting power over, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the domestic insurer&#8217;s voting securities. The application process can be extensive, thereby discouraging the acquisition of a control position. 

Our certificate of incorporation or by-laws contain provisions that permit the Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on the Board, prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent and impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings. 

"," Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. &#160; 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report. It contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report, particularly under the headings &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements.&#8221; &#160; 

General &#160; 

Reportable Segments 

We report our results through three segments: Global Lifestyle, Global Housing and Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other includes corporate employee-related expenses and activities of the holding company. 

In conjunction with the transition of our CEO and chief operating decision maker on January 1, 2022, we changed our segment measure of profitability for our reportable segments to an Adjusted EBITDA metric, as the primary measure used for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing performance, from segment net income from continuing operations, effective as of that date. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the new segment measure of profitability. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information. 

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income from continuing operations, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities, COVID-19 direct and incremental expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt, non-core operations (defined below), net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring costs related to strategic exit activities (outside of normal periodic restructuring and cost management activities), as well as other highly variable or unusual items. 

Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements 

Beginning with second quarter 2022, we changed the calculation of our segment measure of profitability, Adjusted EBITDA, to exclude certain businesses which we expect to fully exit, including the long-tail commercial liability businesses in Global Housing (sharing economy and small commercial businesses), as well as certain legacy long-duration insurance policies within Global Lifestyle (collectively referred to as &#8220;non-core operations&#8221;). All prior period amounts have been revised, which impacts segment Adjusted EBITDA but does not impact consolidated net income. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information. 

We have also revised our prior period financial statements to reflect the correction of an error identified in second quarter 2022 related to reinsurance of claims and benefits payable within the Connected Living business unit in our Global Lifestyle segment, as well as other immaterial errors which were previously recorded in the periods in which we identified them. See Notes 2 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information. Additionally, prior period disclosures have been revised to include Hurricane Eta, which should have been classified as a reportable catastrophe. 

Discontinued Operations 

In August 2021, we completed the sale of the legal entities which comprise the businesses previously reported as the Global Preneed segment and certain businesses previously disposed of through reinsurance, which were previously reported in the Corporate and Other segment (collectively, the &#8220;disposed Global Preneed business&#8221;) to subsidiaries of CUNA Mutual Group for an aggregate purchase price at closing of $1.34 billion. For additional information, refer to &#8220;&#8211;Results of Operations &#8211; Discontinued Operations&#8221; below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

The following discussion covers the year ended December 31, 2022 (&#8220;Twelve Months 2022&#8221;), the year ended December 31, 2021 (&#8220;Twelve Months 2021&#8221;) and the year ended December 31, 2020 (&#8220;Twelve Months 2020&#8221;). Please see the discussion that follows, for each of these segments, for a more detailed comparative analysis. &#160; 

Executive Summary 

Overview 

In December 2022, we finalized our plan to realize greater efficiencies by continuing to simplify our business portfolio and leverage our global footprint to reduce costs. This included realigning our organizational structure, including in Global Housing, and talent to support our business strategy. We also accelerated our ongoing real estate consolidation to support work-from-home arrangements given our increasingly hybrid workforce. We expect to complete these actions in 2023. See &#8220;Item 1 &#8211; Business.&#8221; 

Summary of Financial Results 

Consolidated net income from continuing operations decreased $326.3 million, or 54%, to $276.6 million for Twelve Months 2022 from $602.9 million for Twelve Months 2021. The decline was primarily driven by a net decrease in unrealized gains to unrealized losses from Assurant Ventures (our corporate venture capital team), net realized losses from sales of fixed maturity securities in 2022, and a decrease from non-core operations. 

Global Lifestyle Adjusted EBITDA increased $51.3 million, or 7%, to $753.4 million for Twelve Months 2022 from $702.1 million for Twelve Months 2021. The increase was driven by growth across U.S. Connected Living and Global Automotive, partially offset by weaker performance in Europe and Asia Pacific, including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Growth in Connected Living reflected increased mobile subscribers in North America and more favorable mobile loss experience. Global Automotive increased primarily from higher investment income and favorable loss experience in select ancillary products. For the year, segment results included $24.1 million of income from real estate and a $11.2 million one-time client contract benefit. 

Global Lifestyle net earned premiums, fees and other income increased $196.0 million, or 3%, to $7.94 billion for the Twelve Months 2022 from $7.74 billion for Twelve Months 2021, driven by strong prior period sales in Global Automotive. Connected Living decreased mainly from runoff mobile programs, partially offset by mobile subscriber growth in North America. In-store mobile service and repair contributed $148.4 million of fee income, and as previously announced, is not expected to continue in 2023. 

Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA decreased $55.1 million, or 15%, to $302.0 million for Twelve Months 2022 from $357.1 million for Twelve Months 2021. Pre-tax reportable catastrophes (defined as individual catastrophic events that generate losses in excess of $5.0 million pre-tax, net of reinsurance and client profit sharing adjustments, and including reinstatement and other premiums) increased $17.6 million. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $37.5 million, or 7%, primarily due to declines in Multifamily Housing and Specialty and Other, mainly from higher non-catastrophe loss experience. Lender-placed Insurance increased modestly, as strong revenue growth and improved profitability in fourth quarter 2022 more than offset higher non-catastrophe loss experience throughout the year. Global Housing results were also impacted by increased catastrophe reinsurance costs. 

Global Housing net earned premiums, fees and other income increased $69.0 million, or 4%, to $2.01 billion for Twelve Months 2022 from $1.94 billion for Twelve Months 2021, largely from Lender-placed Insurance. This was driven by higher average insured values, premium rates and policies in-force, including contributions from a new client onboarded in fourth quarter 2022. 

Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA was $(99.2) million for Twelve Months 2022 compared to $(93.3) million for Twelve Months 2021, primarily driven by lower investment income and higher employee-related and third-party expenses. 

Critical Factors Affecting Results &#160; 

Our results depend on, among other things, the appropriateness of our product pricing, underwriting, the accuracy of our reserving methodology for future policyholder benefits and claims, the frequency and severity of reportable and non-reportable catastrophes, returns on and values of invested assets, our investment income, and our ability to realize greater operational efficiencies and manage our expenses. Our results also depend on our ability to profitably grow all of our businesses, including our Connected Living, Renters and Global Automotive businesses, and maintain our position in our Homeowners business. Factors affecting these items, including conditions in the financial markets, the global economy, political conditions and the markets in which we operate, fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation, including the current period of inflationary pressures, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. For more information on these and other factors that could affect our results, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors.&#8221; &#160; 

Our results may also be impacted by our ability to continue to grow in the markets in which we operate, including in our Connected Living, Renters and Global Automotive businesses, which will be impacted by our ability to provide a superior digital-first customer experience, including from our investments in technology and digital initiatives, and capitalize on the smart home opportunity. Our mobile business is subject to volatility in mobile device trade-in volumes and margins based on the actual and anticipated timing of the release of new devices and carrier promotional programs, as well as to changes in customer preferences. Our Homeowners revenues will be impacted by changes in the housing market. In addition, across many of our businesses, we must respond to the threat of disruption and the competition for talent, which has increased due to labor shortages and wage inflation. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Business, Strategic and Operational Risks &#8211; Significant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations, &#8221; &#8220; &#8211; Our mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices in our inventory, and to export compliance and other risks &#8221; and &#8220; &#8211; The success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce.&#8221; 

For Twelve Months 2022, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $596.9 million; net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $262.1 million; and net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $818.4 million. We had $1.54 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022. Please see &#8220; &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; below for further details. 

Revenues &#160; 

We generate revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies, service contracts and related products and services, and from income earned on our investments. Sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income. &#160; 

Our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. We recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends, change in market value of equity securities and sales of investments. Currently, our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Both investment income and changes in market value on these investments can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates. &#160; 

Interest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or losses in our investment portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, inflation and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short-term investments. &#160; 

The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases with fluctuations in interest rates. We also have investments that are subject to pre-payment risk, such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. Interest rate fluctuations may cause actual net investment income and/or timing of cash flows from such investments to differ from estimates made at the time of investment. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates. Therefore, in these circumstances we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest-earning investments. 

Please see &#8220;Item 7A &#8211; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; below for further details. 

Expenses &#160; 

Our expenses are primarily policyholder benefits, underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. &#160; 

Policyholder benefits are affected by our claims management programs, reinsurance coverage, contractual terms and conditions, regulatory requirements, economic conditions, and numerous other factors. Benefits paid or reserves required for future benefits could substantially exceed our expectations, causing a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. &#160; 

Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred costs, general operating expenses and income taxes. &#160; In addition to the restructuring plan announced in December 2022, we continue to undertake various expense savings initiatives while also making investments in talent, capabilities and technology, among other things, which will impact our expenses. 

We also incur interest expense related to our debt. &#160; 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Certain items in our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on estimates and judgment. Differences between actual results and these estimates and judgments could in some cases have material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160; The following critical accounting policies require significant estimates and judgment: 

&#8226; Reserves, Net of Reinsurance 

&#8226; Valuation of Investments 

&#8226; Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill 

Reserves, Net of Reinsurance 

Reserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect significant judgment and estimates about expected future claim payments. Factors used in their calculation include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions. Calculations incorporate assumptions about the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported, reporting lags, expenses, inflation rates, future investment earnings, internal claims processing costs and other relevant factors. While the methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated, the estimation of reserves includes an element of uncertainty given that management is using historical information and methods to project future events and reserve outcomes. &#160; 

The recorded reserves represent our best estimate at a point in time of the ultimate costs of settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims, based upon actuarial assumptions and projections using facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation. The adequacy of reserves may be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, including: changes in the economic cycle, inflation, changes in repair costs, natural or human-made catastrophes, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. 

Many of these items are not directly quantifiable and not all future events can be anticipated when reserves are established. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such estimates are updated. &#160; 

Because establishment of reserves is an inherently complex process involving significant judgment and estimates, there can be no certainty that future settlement amounts for claims incurred through the financial reporting date will not vary from reported claims reserves. Future loss development could require reserves to be increased or decreased, which could have a material effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases or decreases are made. However, based on information currently available, we believe our reserve estimates are adequate. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital &#8221; and &#8220; &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; Actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management&#8221; for more detail on this risk. 

Reinsurance Recoverables 

We utilize reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and client risk and profit sharing. Reinsurance premiums paid are amortized as reductions to premium over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. Reinsurance recoverables include amounts we are owed by reinsurers for claims paid as well as those included in reserve estimates that are subject to the reinsurance. 

We use a probability of default and loss given default methodology in estimating an expected credit loss allowance, whereby the credit ratings of reinsurers are used in determining the probability of default. The allowance is established for reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid future policy benefits and claims and benefits. Prior to applying default factors, the net exposure to credit risk is reduced for any collateral for which the right of offset exists, such as funds withheld, assets held in trust and letters of credit, which are part of the reinsurance arrangements, with adjustments to include consideration of credit exposure on the collateral. Our methodology incorporates historical default factors for each reinsurer based on their credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratings service. The allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing and other relevant factors. 

In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non-affiliated companies. The following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Ceded future policyholder benefits and expense $ 360.6 $ 338.4 Ceded unearned premium 5,158.1 4,950.0 Ceded claims and benefits payable 1,312.7 824.0 Ceded paid losses 174.5 68.8 Total $ 7,005.9 $ 6,181.2 ##TABLE_END

For additional information regarding our reserves and reinsurance recoverables, see Notes 2, 5, 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Short Duration Contracts &#160; 

Claims and benefits payable reserves for short duration contracts include (1) case reserves for known claims which are unpaid as of the balance sheet date; (2) IBNR reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our reserves and assumptions where necessary. 

Ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated utilizing generally accepted actuarial loss reserving methods. Both paid claims development as well as case incurred development are typically analyzed at the product or product grouping level, considering product size and data credibility. The reserving methods widely employed by us include the Chain Ladder, Munich Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. For Global Housing, reportable catastrophes are analyzed and reserved for separately using a frequency and severity approach. 

The methods all involve aggregating paid and case-incurred loss data by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age for each product grouping. As the data ages, development factors are calculated that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. By selecting loss development factors indicative of remaining development, known losses are projected to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period. The underlying premise of the Chain Ladder method is that future claims development is best estimated using past claims development, whereas the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method employs a combination of past claims development and prior estimates of ultimate losses based on an expected loss ratio. The Munich Chain Ladder method incorporates the correlations between paid and incurred development in projecting future development factors, and is typically more applicable to products experiencing variability in incurred to paid ratios. 

Each of these methods applied to the data groupings produces an estimate of the loss reserves for the product grouping. The best estimate is generally selected from a blend of the different methods. The IBNR associated with the best estimate is then allocated to accident year based on a weighting of the underlying actuarial methods. The determination of the best estimate is based on many factors, including: &#160; 

&#8226; the nature and extent of the underlying assumptions; 

&#8226; the quality and applicability of historical data - whether internal or industry data; 

&#8226; current and expected future economic and market conditions; 

&#8226; regulatory, legislative, and judicial considerations; 

&#8226; the extent of data segmentation - data should be homogeneous yet credible enough for loss development methods to apply; 

&#8226; trends in loss frequency and severity for various causes of loss; 

&#8226; consideration of the distribution of loss reserves, management&#8217;s selection of the best estimate that may exceed an estimate based on median values, suggesting that favorable development may be more likely than unfavorable development; and 

&#8226; hindsight testing of prior loss estimates - the loss estimates on some product lines will vary from actual loss experience more than others. 

When employing the reserving methods, consideration is given to contractual requirements, historical utilization trends and payment patterns, coverage changes, seasonality, product mix, the legislative and regulatory environment, economic factors, natural catastrophes and other relevant factors. We consistently apply reserving principles and methodologies from year to year, while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors. 

While management has used judgment in establishing its best estimate of required reserves, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates. Two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity, which is a measure of the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls, changes in economic activity and weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations. &#160; 

If the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate reserves required will be different than management&#8217;s estimate. The effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity on our ultimate costs for claims occurring in 2022 would be as follows: 

##TABLE_START

&#160; 

Non-Core Operations 

Short duration contracts in non-core operations consist of the sharing economy and small commercial products previously reported within Global Housing. While the contracts are classified as short duration, the coverages were predominantly commercial liability and have a long reporting and settlement tail compared to property coverages which make up most of our core operations. 

The reserving methodology described for other short duration contacts is applicable for non-core operations. Given the nature of commercial liability coverages and its relatively long claim runoff duration, additional emphasis is placed on elevated loss activity from increasing attorney involvement and analysis of individual case reserve adequacy on known claims. This is done through use of average cost per claim methods that include an allowance for future inflation impacts, detailed open claim inventory analysis, and leveraging industry development patterns to supplement our own historical claims experience. 

Long Duration Contracts, including Disposed and Runoff Long Duration Lines 

Reserves for future policy benefits represent the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Reserve assumptions reflect best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity, expenses and withdrawal rates. These assumptions are based on our experience to the extent it is credible, modified where appropriate to reflect current trends, industry experience and provisions for possible unfavorable deviation. We also record an unearned revenue reserve which represents premiums received which have not yet been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. 

Risks related to the reserves recorded for certain discontinued individual life, annuity and long-term care insurance policies have been fully ceded via reinsurance. While we have not been released from our contractual obligation to the policyholders, changes in and deviations from economic, mortality, morbidity, and withdrawal assumptions used in the calculation of these reserves will not directly affect our results of operations unless there is a default by the assuming reinsurer. 

Valuation of Investments 

In determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are primarily based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs. If these observable inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable 

inputs or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments. The methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments and the price ultimately realized for investments depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market. 

See also Notes 2, 8 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; Our investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition &#8221; and &#8220; &#8211; Investments&#8221; contained in this Item 7. &#160; 

Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill 

Our goodwill related to acquisitions of businesses was $2.60 billion and $2.57 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We review our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators include: a significant adverse change in legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in our expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. The evaluation of such factors requires considerable management judgment. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the operating segment or one level below, if that component is a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews such information. Components within an operating segment can be aggregated into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value, including goodwill, of the reporting unit over its fair value. An impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 

Our Global Lifestyle operating segment is disaggregated into the following three reporting units: Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Financial Services. Our reporting unit for goodwill testing was at the same level as the operating segment for Global Housing. In second quarter of 2022, we exited the sharing economy and small commercial businesses (which are now included within non-core operations) and reclassified $7.8 million of goodwill from Global Housing to Corporate and Other. The entire $7.8 million of goodwill reported in Corporate and Other was impaired and written off in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

The following table illustrates the amount of goodwill carried by operating segment as of the dates indicated: 

##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Global Lifestyle (1) $ 2,193.9 $ 2,192.1 Global Housing (2) 409.1 379.5 Total $ 2,603.0 $ 2,571.6 ##TABLE_END

(1) As of December 31, 2022, $689.1 million, $1,432.9 million and $71.9 million of goodwill was assigned to the Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Financial Services reporting unit, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, $698.7 million, $1,420.5 million, and $72.9 million of goodwill was assigned to the Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Financial Services reporting unit, respectively. 

(2) Goodwill of $7.8 million associated with the sharing economy and small commercial businesses was included in Global Housing as of December 31, 2021 and subsequently reclassified to Corporate and Other, impaired and written off in 2022. 

Quantitative Impairment Testing 

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment for the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing reporting units given the uncertainty in macro-economic conditions, inflation concerns, and lingering COVID-19 impacts on industry performance. Based on this quantitative assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the reporting units&#8217; fair values were more than their carrying amounts and that there was no impairment for the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing reporting units as of October 1, 2022. 

The determination of fair value of the reporting units requires many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include earnings and required capital projections discussed above, discount rates, terminal growth rates, operating income and dividend forecasts for each reporting unit and the weighting assigned to the results of each valuation method included in the fair value calculation. Changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the goodwill impairment assessment. 

Should the operating results of these reporting units decline substantially compared to projected results, or should further interest rate declines increase the net unrealized investment portfolio gain position, we could determine that we need to perform an updated impairment test due to the potential impairment indicators, which may require the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in any of the reporting units. 

For the fourth quarter of 2022 quantitative assessment, had the net book value for of the reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value, the Company would have recognized a goodwill impairment loss for the difference up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Net Income from Continuing Operations 

Consolidated net income from continuing operations decreased $326.3 million, or 54%, to $276.6 million for Twelve Months 2022 from $602.9 million for Twelve Months 2021, primarily due to a net decrease in unrealized gains from changes in fair value of equity securities mostly driven by the four equity positions that went public in 2021 through SPAC mergers. The changes in fair value of these investments resulted in $84.1 million of after-tax unrealized losses in 2022 compared to $67.5 million of after-tax unrealized gains in 2021. The decrease was also due to $50.3 million of net realized losses from sales of fixed maturity securities in 2022 compared to $13.6 million of net realized gains from sales in 2021, and a $52.8 million after- 

tax decrease in earnings from our non-core operations mostly related to adverse prior year reserve development from the sharing economy business. Also contributing to the decrease was $41.8 million of after-tax restructuring costs related to realigning our organizational structure and the acceleration of real estate consolidation strategy announced in December 2022, and lower earnings contributions from Global Housing, mainly due to higher non-catastrophe loss experience, partially offset by higher earnings contributions from Global Lifestyle driven by favorable results from both Connected Living and Global Automotive. 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 

Net Income from Continuing Operations 

Consolidated net income from continuing operations increased $83.5 million, or 16%, to $602.9 million for Twelve Months 2021 from $519.4 million for Twelve Months 2020, primarily due to higher net realized gains on investments and fair value changes to equity securities compared to net losses in the prior period, including $67.5 million of after-tax unrealized gains from four equity positions that went public during Twelve Months 2021, the absence of $25.5 million of after-tax net unrealized losses on collateralized loan obligations in Twelve Months 2020 and $19.2 million of after-tax unrealized gains from equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative. The increase was also due to favorable earnings contributions from Global Lifestyle, mainly due to continued organic growth and favorable loss experience in Global Automotive. These increases were partially offset by the absence of an $84.4 million tax benefit that was recorded in Twelve Months 2020 related to the utilization of net operating losses in connection with the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. 

Global Lifestyle 

The table below presents information regarding the Global Lifestyle segment&#8217;s results of operations for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Revenues: Net earned premiums $ 6,829.9 $ 6,712.7 $ 6,436.2 Fees and other income 1,106.2 1,027.4 895.4 Net investment income 249.4 198.8 191.5 Total revenues 8,185.5 7,938.9 7,523.1 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits 1,325.5 1,333.1 1,411.8 Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses 6,106.6 5,903.7 5,475.3 Total benefits, losses and expenses 7,432.1 7,236.8 6,887.1 Global Lifestyle Adjusted EBITDA $ 753.4 $ 702.1 $ 636.0 Net earned premiums, fees and other income: Connected Living $ 4,233.4 $ 4,303.2 $ 4,216.5 Global Automotive 3,702.7 3,436.9 3,115.1 Total $ 7,936.1 $ 7,740.1 $ 7,331.6 Net earned premiums, fees and other income: Domestic $ 6,156.3 $ 5,871.5 $ 5,402.3 International 1,779.8 1,868.6 1,929.3 Total $ 7,936.1 $ 7,740.1 $ 7,331.6 ##TABLE_END

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Adjusted EBITDA increased $51.3 million, or 7%, to $753.4 million for Twelve Months 2022 from $702.1 million for Twelve Months 2021, driven by growth across U.S. Connected Living and Global Automotive, partially offset by weaker performance in Europe and Asia Pacific, including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Growth in Connected Living reflected increased mobile subscribers in North America and more favorable mobile loss experience. Global Automotive increased primarily from higher net investment income, after client profit sharing, favorable loss experience in select domestic ancillary products and expansion across distribution channels. Segment results included $24.1 million of income from real estate and a $11.2 million one-time client contract benefit. 

Total revenues increased $246.6 million, or 3%, to $8.19 billion for Twelve Months 2022 from $7.94 billion for Twelve Months 2021. Net earned premiums increased $117.2 million, or 2%, primarily driven by continued organic growth from strong prior period U.S. sales in our Global Automotive business across all distribution channels and domestic mobile subscriber growth within our cable operator distribution channel. The increase in net earned premiums was partially offset by the run-off of certain global mobile programs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Fees and other income increased $78.8 million, or 8%, mainly driven by an increase in global mobile devices serviced, which included $148.4 million from in-store mobile service and repair program, which, as previously announced, is not expected to continue in 2023. Net investment income increased $50.6 million, or 25%, primarily due to income from higher fixed maturity yields and asset levels and higher real estate related income. 

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $195.3 million, or 3%, to $7.43 billion for Twelve Months 2022 from $7.24 billion for Twelve Months 2021. Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $202.9 million, or 3%, mainly due to higher commission expenses, primarily from growth across our Global Automotive business and domestic mobile subscriber growth within our cable operator distribution channel, as well as higher cost of sales in Connected Living due to an increase in global mobile devices serviced, which included expenses from the in-store mobile service and repair program, and higher operating costs to support growth. This was partially offset by lower commission expenses related to the run-off of certain global mobile programs. The increase in total benefits losses and expenses was partially offset by a decrease in policyholder benefits of $7.6 million, or 1%, due to the run-off of certain global mobile programs and favorable loss experience 

from select domestic ancillary products in Global Automotive and from mobile device protection products, partially offset by growth across our Global Automotive and Connected Living businesses. 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 

Adjusted EBITDA increased $66.1 million, or 10%, to $702.1 million for Twelve Months 2021 from $636.0 million for Twelve Months 2020, primarily due to Global Automotive from underlying growth from prior period sales driven by expanded and new client relationships globally, favorable loss experience in select ancillary products and $10.4 million of one-time benefits in Twelve Months 2021 that are not expected to repeat. Connected Living also contributed to the increase, led by mobile, mainly from higher mobile trade-in volumes, including our acquisition of Hyla Mobile, Inc.(&#8220;Hyla&#8221;), better performance in Asia Pacific and additional domestic mobile subscribers across carrier and cable operator clients, as well as financial services and other products, mainly due to claims and sales recoveries as Twelve Months 2020 included unfavorable impacts related to COVID-19. This increase was partially offset by investments to build out service and repair capabilities in mobile and an $11.1 million benefit for an extended service contract client recoverable in Twelve Months 2020. 

Total revenues increased $415.8 million, or 6%, to $7.94 billion for Twelve Months 2021 from $7.52 billion for Twelve Months 2020. Net earned premiums increased $276.5 million, or 4%, primarily driven by continued growth from strong U.S. sales in our Global Automotive business across all distribution channels. The increase in net earned premiums was partially offset by modest declines in Connected Living, as the run-off of certain global mobile programs was offset by growth in extended service contract programs and domestic mobile subscribers within our cable operator distribution channel. Fees and other income increased $132.0 million, or 15%, primarily driven by Connected Living from higher mobile repair and logistics volumes mainly from Hyla contributions and mobile carrier promotions, partially offset by the $176 million reduction from the previously disclosed program contract change. Net investment income increased $7.3 million, or 4%, primarily due to higher income from real estate related investments. 

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $349.7 million, or 5%, to $7.24 billion for Twelve Months 2021 from $6.89 billion for Twelve Months 2020. Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $428.4 million, or 8%, primarily due to growth across the businesses, including higher mobile repair and logistics volumes, with contributions from Hyla, and investments to build out service and repair capabilities, partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed program contract change. The increase in total benefits, losses and expenses was partially offset by a $78.7 million, or 6%, decrease in policyholder benefits, primarily due to the run-off of certain global mobile programs in our Connected Living business and lower loss experience in select ancillary products in Global Automotive, partially offset by growth across our Global Automotive and Connected Living businesses. 

Global Housing 

The table below presents information regarding the Global Housing segment&#8217;s results of operations for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Revenues: Net earned premiums $ 1,874.0 $ 1,796.6 $ 1,758.3 Fees and other income 136.4 144.8 143.7 Net investment income 80.0 78.0 68.5 Total revenues 2,090.4 2,019.4 1,970.5 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits 915.2 798.8 794.3 Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses 873.2 863.5 858.2 Total benefits, losses and expenses 1,788.4 1,662.3 1,652.5 Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA $ 302.0 $ 357.1 $ 318.0 Impact of reportable catastrophes $ 172.7 $ 155.1 $ 178.5 Net earned premiums, fees and other income: Lender-placed Insurance $ 1,124.0 $ 1,065.9 $ 1,052.5 Multifamily Housing 482.4 482.3 451.6 Specialty and Other 404.0 393.2 397.9 Total $ 2,010.4 $ 1,941.4 $ 1,902.0 ##TABLE_END

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Adjusted EBITDA decreased $55.1 million, or 15%, to $302.0 million for Twelve Months 2022 from $357.1 million for Twelve Months 2021. Pre-tax reportable catastrophes for Twelve Months 2022 increased $17.6 million to $172.7 million, compared to $155.1 million for Twelve Months 2021, primarily due to Hurricane Ian. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $37.5 million, or 7%, mainly driven by higher non-catastrophe loss experience across all major products, due to higher claims severity from inflation, particularly from elevated fire losses, as well as higher catastrophe reinsurance costs. The decrease was partially offset by premium from higher average insured values, premium rates and policies in force in Lender-placed Insurance. 

Total revenues increased $71.0 million, or 4%, to $2.09 billion for Twelve Months 2022 from $2.02 billion for Twelve Months 2021. Net earned premiums increased $77.4 million, or 4%, primarily due to higher average insured values, policies in force and premium rates in our Lender-placed Insurance business, including contributions from a new client onboarded during fourth quarter 2022, partially offset by higher catastrophe reinsurance costs including higher reinstatement premiums. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in fees and other income of $8.4 million, or 6%, primarily due to a decline in fees from our Multifamily Housing and Lender-placed Insurance businesses. 

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $126.1 million, or 8%, to $1.79 billion for Twelve Months 2022 from $1.66 billion for Twelve Months 2021. Policyholder benefits increased $116.4 million, or 15%, due to higher non-catastrophe loss experience as described above. Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $9.7 million, or 1%, mainly due to higher operating costs to support growth, with general and administrative expenses remaining relatively flat through operational savings initiatives. 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 

Adjusted EBITDA increased $39.1 million, or 12%, to $357.1 million for Twelve Months 2021 compared to $318.0 million for Twelve Months 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for Twelve Months 2021 included $155.1 million of pre-tax reportable catastrophes, primarily related to Hurricane Ida and the Texas winter storms, compared to $178.5 million for Twelve Months 2020. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA increased $15.7 million, or 3%, driven by premium rate and average insured value increases in our Lender-placed Insurance business. These increases were partially offset by decreases from higher non-catastrophe loss experience from an anticipated increase to more normalized levels than experienced in Twelve Months 2020 as well as lower REO volumes related to COVID-19 foreclosure moratoriums in Lender-placed Insurance. 

Total revenues increased $48.9 million, or 2%, to $2.02 billion for Twelve Months 2021 from $1.97 billion for Twelve Months 2020. Net earned premiums increased $38.3 million, or 2%, primarily due to average insured value and premium rate increases in our Lender-placed Insurance business and continued growth from renters insurance in our Multifamily Housing business. These increases were partially offset by lower REO volumes, higher estimated catastrophe premium, higher reinsurance reinstatement premium primarily related to Hurricane Ida, and a decline in Specialty and Other from client run-offs. Net investment income increased $9.5 million, or 14%, primarily due to higher income from real estate related investments. 

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $9.8 million, or 1%, to $1.66 billion for Twelve Months 2021 from $1.65 billion for Twelve Months 2020. Policyholder benefits increased $4.5 million, or 1%, primarily from higher non-catastrophe losses across all lines of business from an anticipated increase to more normalized levels than experienced in Twelve Months 2020, partially offset by a decrease in reportable catastrophe losses. Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.3 million, or 1%, primarily due to an increase in expenses consistent with net earned premium growth and continued investments in Multifamily Housing, partially offset by a decrease in commission expense in our Specialty and Other business. 

Corporate and Other 

The table below presents information regarding the Corporate and Other segment&#8217;s results of operations for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Revenues: Net earned premiums $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Fees and other income 0.5 0.3 0.5 Net investment income 26.9 31.9 17.6 Total revenues 27.4 32.2 18.1 Benefits, losses and expenses Policyholder benefits 0.5 &#8212; &#8212; General and administrative expenses 126.1 125.5 142.5 Total benefits, losses and expenses 126.6 125.5 142.5 Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA $ (99.2) $ (93.3) $ (124.4) ##TABLE_END

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Adjusted EBITDA was $(99.2) million for Twelve Months 2022 compared to $(93.3) million for Twelve Months 2021. The increase in the loss was primarily due to lower investment income and higher employee-related and technology expenses. 

Total revenues decreased $4.8 million, or 15%, to $27.4 million for Twelve Months 2022 from $32.2 million for Twelve Months 2021 primarily driven by a decrease in net investment income of $5.0 million, or 16%, mostly due to a reduction in income from limited partnerships, partially offset by increased income from higher invested assets balances, primarily reflecting the remaining proceeds from the sale of Global Preneed. 

Total benefits, losses and expenses increased $1.1 million, or 1%, to $126.6 million for Twelve Months 2022 from $125.5 million for Twelve Months 2021. General and administrative expenses increased modestly, primarily due to higher employee-related and technology expenses. 

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 

Adjusted EBITDA was $(93.3) million for Twelve Months 2021 compared to $(124.4) million for Twelve Months 2020, primarily driven by lower general operating expenses and an increase in net investment income. 

Total Revenue increased $14.1 million, or 78%, to $32.2 million for Twelve Months 2021 from $18.1 million for Twelve Months 2020, primarily d riven by a $14.3 million increase in net investment income, mostly driven by gains from the sale of real estate joint venture properties and higher income from limited partnerships. 

Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses decreased $17.0 million, or 12%, to $125.5 million for Twelve Months 2021 from $142.5 million for Twelve Months 2020, primarily due to lower operating expenses, including employee-related and third-party expenses. 

Discontinued Operations 

The table below presents information regarding the results of the discontinued operations for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Revenues: Net earned premiums $ 42.6 $ 66.9 Fees and other income 91.0 151.1 Net investment income 168.4 289.3 Net realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities 4.2 (8.0) Gain on disposal of businesses 916.2 &#8212; Total revenues 1,222.4 499.3 Benefits, losses and expenses: Policyholder benefits 172.7 284.4 Underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses 85.2 142.6 Goodwill impairment &#8212; 137.8 Total benefits, losses and expenses 257.9 564.8 Income (loss) before provision for income taxes 964.5 (65.5) Provision for income taxes 205.6 12.2 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 758.9 $ (77.7) ##TABLE_END

Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 

Net income from discontinued operations was $758.9 million for Twelve Months 2021 compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $77.7 million for Twelve Months 2020. The change was primarily due to a $720.1 million after-tax gain on the sale of the disposed Global Preneed business in Twelve Months 2021. The gain included $606.0 million in after-tax AOCI, primarily net unrealized gains on investments, that was recognized in earnings upon the sale. The increase was also due to the absence of a $137.8 million after-tax goodwill impairment on the disposed Global Preneed business from Twelve Months 2020. These items were partially offset by lower operating results for the disposed Global Preneed business as Twelve Months 2021 included only seven months of results since the sale closed on August 2, 2021. 

Total revenues increased $723.1 million to $1.22 billion for Twelve Months 2021 from $499.3 million for Twelve Months 2020, primarily due to the gain on the sale of the disposed Global Preneed business. The gain included $774.2 million of pre-tax AOCI, primarily net unrealized gains on investments, that was recognized in earnings upon sale. The increase in total revenues was partially offset by a $120.9 million, or 42%, decrease in net investment income, a $60.1 million, or 40%, decrease in fees and other income and a $24.3 million, or 36%, decrease in net earned premiums, primarily because Twelve Months 2021 included only seven months of results. 

Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $306.9 million, or 54%, to $257.9 million for Twelve Months 2021 from $564.8 million for Twelve Months 2020, primarily due to the absence of a $137.8 million goodwill impairment on the disposed Global Preneed business from Twelve Months 2020. The decrease in total benefits, losses and expenses was also due to a $111.7 million, or 39%, decrease in policyholder benefits and a $57.4 million, or 40%, decrease in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily because Twelve Months 2021 included only seven months of results. 

Investments &#160; 

We had total investments of $7.52 billion and $8.67 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net unrealized gains/losses on our fixed maturity securities portfolio decreased $948.5 million during Twelve Months 2022, from a $311.4 million unrealized gain at December 31, 2021 to a $637.1 million unrealized loss at December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in Treasury yields. 

The following table shows the credit quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio as of the dates indicated:

(1) The investment income from the real estate funds includes income attributable to non-controlling interest of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Net investment income increased $49.7 million, or 16%, to $364.1 million for Twelve Months 2022 from $314.4 million for Twelve Months 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher yields on fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents, and higher income from commercial mortgage loans on real estate due to higher invested assets, partially offset by lower income from other investments mostly due to a reduction in income from limited partnerships. 

Net investment income increased $28.8 million, or 10%, to $314.4 million for Twelve Months 2021 from $285.6 million for Twelve Months 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher income from other investments mostly due to higher income from sales of real estate joint venture partnerships and higher valuations in our real estate joint venture and other partnerships. Fixed maturity income increased, mostly due to higher asset levels, partially offset by lower yields. Investment expenses decreased due to prior year costs associated with the disposed Global Preneed business and one-time expenses related 

to the outsourcing of our real estate asset management. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in income from short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents mainly due to continued low yields. 

Net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities were $179.7 million for Twelve Months 2022 compared to net realized gains and fair value changes to equity securities of $128.2 million for Twelve Months 2021. The change in Twelve Months 2022 was primarily driven by $132.7 million of net unrealized losses from changes in fair value of equity securities that included a $106.4 million decrease in net unrealized gains from four equity positions that went public in Twelve Months 2021. The change in Twelve Months 2022 was also driven by $63.7 million of net realized losses on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by $18.1 million of net realized gains on sales of equity securities. The change in Twelve Months 2021 was primarily driven by $112.4 million of net unrealized gains from changes in fair value of equity securities that included $85.4 million of unrealized gains from three equity positions that went public in third quarter 2021, and $17.2 million of net realized gains from sales of fixed maturity securities. 

As of December 31, 2022, we owned $17.4 million of securities guaranteed by financial guarantee insurance companies. Included in this amount was $14.7 million of municipal securities, whose credit rating was A+ with the guarantee, but would have had a rating of AA- without the guarantee.

Liquidity and Capital Resources &#160; 

The following section discusses our ability to generate cash flows from each of our subsidiaries, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet our operating and growth needs. Management believes that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our needs over the next twelve months, including the ability to pay interest on our debt and dividends on our common stock. 

Regulatory Requirements &#160; 

Assurant, Inc. is a holding company and, as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends and make such other payments is regulated by the states and territories in which our subsidiaries are domiciled. These dividend regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary, but generally require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends they can pay to the holding company. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Legal and Regulatory Risks &#8211; Changes in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. &#8221; Along with solvency regulations, the primary driver in determining the amount of capital used for dividends from insurance subsidiaries is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from A.M. Best. For the year ending December 31, 2023, the maximum amount of dividends our regulated U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us, under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval, is approximately $344.7 million. Our international and non-insurance subsidiaries provide additional sources of dividends. 

Regulators or rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries or the enterprise. In 2022, the following actions were taken by the rating agencies: 

A.M. Best 

&#8226; In August 2022, upgraded the insurance financial strength ratings on our insurance operating subsidiaries, American Bankers Life Assurance Company of Florida (&#8220;ABLAC&#8221;) and Caribbean American Life Assurance Company, to A from A- with a stable outlook. 

Moody&#8217;s 

&#8226; In June 2022, upgraded the senior debt rating of Assurant, Inc. to Baa2 from Baa3 with a stable outlook and upgraded the insurance financial strength ratings on our insurance operating subsidiaries, American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida, ABLAC and American Security Insurance Company, to A2 from A3 with a stable outlook. 

For further information on our ratings and the risks of ratings downgrades, see &#8220;Item 1 &#8211; Business &#8211; Ratings&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; A decline in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. &#8221; 

Holding Company 

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $446.1 million in holding company liquidity, $221.1 million above our targeted minimum level of $225.0 million. The target minimum level of holding company liquidity, which can be used for unforeseen capital needs at our subsidiaries or liquidity needs at the holding company, is calibrated based on approximately one year of corporate operating losses and interest expenses. We use the term &#8220;holding company liquidity&#8221; to represent the portion of cash and other liquid marketable securities held at Assurant, Inc., out of a total of $532.1 million of holding company investment securities and cash, which we are not otherwise holding for a specific purpose as of the balance sheet date. We can use such assets for stock repurchases, stockholder dividends, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 

Dividends or returns of capital paid by our subsidiaries, net of infusions of liquid assets and excluding amounts used for or as a result of acquisitions or received from dispositions, were $549.5 million and $728.6 million for Twelve Months 2022 and Twelve Months 2021, respectively. Twelve Months 2021 included approximately $12.0 million of dividends from subsidiaries, net of infusions, in the disposed Global Preneed business. We use these cash inflows primarily to pay holding company operating expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our common stockholders, to fund investments and acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock. &#160; From time to time, we may also seek to purchase outstanding debt in open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions. 

Dividends and Repurchases 

During Twelve Months 2022 and Twelve Months 2021, we made common stock repurchases and paid dividends to our common stockholders of $717.8 million and $1.00 billion, respectively. 

On January 19, 2023, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per common share payable on March 20, 2023 to stockholders of record as of February 27, 2023. We paid dividends of $0.70 per common share on December 19, 2022 to stockholders of record as of November 28, 2022. This represented a 3% increase to the quarterly dividend of $0.68 per common share paid on September 19, June 20, and March 21, 2022. 

Any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon various factors, including: our subsidiaries&#8217; payments of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial condition and capital requirements; general business conditions and growth prospects; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factors the Board deems relevant. The Credit Facility (as defined below) also contains limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and repurchase capital stock if we are in default, or such dividend payments or repurchases would cause us to be in default, of our obligations thereunder. In addition, if we elect to defer the payment of interest on our 7.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due March 2048 or our 5.25% Subordinated Notes due January 2061 (refer to &#8220;&#8212; Senior and Subordinated Notes &#8221; below), we generally may not make payments on or repurchase any shares of our capital stock. 

During Twelve Months 2022, we repurchased 3,347,558 shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $567.6 million, exclusive of commissions. In May 2021, the Board authorized a share repurchase program for up to $900.0 million of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2022, $274.5 million aggregate cost at purchase remained unused under the repurchase authorization. The timing and the amount of future repurchases will depend on various factors, including those listed above. 

As previously announced, in second quarter 2022 and within one year of closing the transaction, we completed the return of $900.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of the disposed Global Preneed business through share repurchases. For additional information, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Assurant Subsidiaries 

The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and net investment income. Cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries&#8217; funds in order to generate investment income. 

We conduct periodic asset liability studies to measure the duration of our insurance liabilities, to develop optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for our significant lines of business and ultimately to assess that cash flows are sufficient to meet the timing of cash needs. These studies are conducted in accordance with formal company-wide Asset Liability Management guidelines. &#160; 

To complete a study for a particular line of business, models are developed to project asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet items under a varied set of plausible economic scenarios. These models consider many factors including the current investment portfolio, the required capital for the related assets and liabilities, our tax position and projected cash flows from both existing and projected new business. For risks related to modeling, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Financial Risks &#8211; 

Actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management. &#8221; 

Alternative asset portfolio asset allocations are analyzed for significant lines of business. An investment portfolio maturity structure is then selected from these profiles given our return hurdle and risk appetite. Scenario testing of significant liability assumptions and new business projections is also performed. 

Our liabilities generally do not include policyholder optionality, which means that the timing of payments is generally insensitive to the interest rate environment. In addition, our investment portfolio is largely comprised of highly liquid public fixed maturity securities with a sufficient component of such securities invested that are near maturity which may be sold with minimal risk of loss to meet cash needs. 

Generally, our subsidiaries&#8217; premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, provide sufficient cash to pay claims and expenses. However, there may be instances when unexpected cash needs arise in excess of that available from usual operating sources. In such instances, we have several options to raise needed funds, including selling assets from the subsidiaries&#8217; investment portfolios, using holding company cash (if available), issuing commercial paper, or drawing funds from the Credit Facility. 

Senior and Subordinated Notes &#160; 

The following table shows the principal amount and carrying value of our outstanding debt, less unamortized discount and issuance costs as applicable, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Principal Amount Carrying Value Principal Amount Carrying Value 4.20% Senior Notes due September 2023 225.0 224.7 300.0 299.0 4.90% Senior Notes due March 2028 300.0 297.8 300.0 297.5 3.70% Senior Notes due February 2030 350.0 347.6 350.0 347.3 2.65% Senior Notes due January 2032 350.0 346.7 350.0 346.4 6.75% Senior Notes due February 2034 275.0 272.5 275.0 272.4 7.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due March 2048 400.0 396.5 400.0 395.9 5.25% Subordinated Notes due January 2061 250.0 244.1 250.0 244.0 Total Debt $ 2,129.9 $ 2,202.5 ##TABLE_END

In June 2022, we redeemed $75.0 million of the $300.0 million then outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2023 Senior Notes at a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In connection with the redemption, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.9 million. In the next five years, we have one upcoming debt maturity in September 2023 when the 2023 Senior Notes will become due and payable. For additional information, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program 

We have a $500.0 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) with a syndicate of banks arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Credit Facility provides for revolving loans and the issuance of multi-bank, syndicated letters of credit and letters of credit from a sole issuing bank in an aggregate amount of $500.0 million, which may be increased up to $700.0 million. The Credit Facility is available until December 2026, provided we are in compliance with all covenants. The Credit Facility has a sublimit for letters of credit issued thereunder of $50.0 million. The proceeds from these loans may be used for our commercial paper program or for general corporate purposes. 

We made no borrowings using the Credit Facility during Twelve Months 2022 and no loans were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 

Our commercial paper program requires us to maintain liquidity facilities either in an available amount equal to any outstanding notes from the program or in an amount sufficient to maintain the ratings assigned to the notes issued from the program. Our commercial paper is rated AMB-1 by A.M. Best, P-2 by Moody&#8217;s and A-2 by S&#38;P. Our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities. This program is currently backed up by the Credit Facility, of which $499.8 million out of the $500.0 million was available as of December 31, 2022, due to $0.2 million of letters of credit outstanding. 

We did not use the commercial paper program during Twelve Months 2022 and there were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 

For additional information, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Letters of Credit &#160; 

Letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business. These letters of credit are supported by commitments under which we are required to indemnify the financial institution issuing the letter of credit if the letter of credit is drawn. We had $2.7 million and $7.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. &#160; 

Cash Flows 

We monitor cash flows at the consolidated, holding company and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed. &#160; 

The table below shows our recent net cash flows for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities - continuing operations $ 596.9 $ 630.5 $ 1,114.3 Operating activities - discontinued operations &#8212; 151.2 227.7 Operating activities 596.9 781.7 1,342.0 Investing activities - continuing operations (262.1) 302.8 (519.4) Investing activities - discontinued operations &#8212; (145.2) (215.8) Investing activities (262.1) 157.6 (735.2) Financing activities - continuing operations (818.4) (1,089.8) (264.8) Financing activities - discontinued operations &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Financing activities (818.4) (1,089.8) (264.8) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents - continuing operations (34.5) (23.5) 19.4 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents - discontinued operations &#8212; 0.2 0.1 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (34.5) (23.3) 19.5 Net change in cash $ (518.1) $ (173.8) $ 361.5 ##TABLE_END

Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 

Operating Activities &#160; 

We typically generate operating cash inflows from premiums collected from our insurance products, fees received for services and income received from our investments while outflows consist of policy acquisition costs, benefits paid and operating expenses. These net cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance products and required capital supporting these products. Our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees, and investment income received and expenses paid. 

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $596.9 million and $630.5 million for Twelve Months 2022 and Twelve Months 2021, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of our mobile business operations mostly due to lower collections of premiums and fees receivable and an increase in payments to vendors for the acquisition of mobile devices used to meet insurance claims or generate profits through sales to third parties. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash from the receipt of a tax refund that was in excess of tax payments for Twelve Months 2022. 

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $630.5 million and $1.11 billion for Twelve Months 2021 and Twelve Months 2020, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of certain cash payments and business activities from our Global Lifestyle segment. The primary factors contributing to the variance included timing of cumulative payments to a vendor related to various programs for acquiring mobile devices used to meet insurance claims or generate profits through sales to third parties and higher commission payments associated with fourth quarter 2020 premiums that were paid in first quarter 2021. The decrease was also due to the absence of 

a $204.9 million tax refund, including interest, related to the ability to carry back operating losses to prior periods under the CARES Act that was collected during Twelve Months 2020 and higher tax payments, net of refunds, primarily due to the gain on sale of the disposed Global Preneed business and an increase in taxable income for Twelve Months 2021. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in premiums collected in connection with the continued growth in Global Automotive. 

Investing Activities &#160; 

Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $262.1 million for Twelve Months 2022 compared to net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations of $302.8 million for Twelve Months 2021. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in cash from sales of subsidiaries, partially offset by an increase in cash from sales and maturities, net of purchases, and a change in our short term investments, due to ongoing management of our investment portfolio. Twelve Months 2021 included $1.31 billion of proceeds, net of $27.3 million of cash transferred, from the sale of the disposed Global Preneed business that were mostly reinvested in short-term high quality liquid fixed income investments. 

Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $302.8 million for Twelve Months 2021 compared to net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $519.4 million for Twelve Months 2020. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by an increase in cash from sales and maturities, net of purchases, due to the ongoing management of our investment portfolio and a reduction in net cash used for acquisitions. Twelve Months 2021 included $1.27 billion of proceeds from the sale of the disposed Global Preneed business that were mostly reinvested within our investment portfolio. Twelve Months 2020 included $135.8 million of net cash used for the AFAS acquisition, $276.8 million of net cash used for the Hyla acquisition and $51.3 million of cash outflow, net of $22.0 million of proceeds from a foreign currency hedge, for the sale of our interests in Ik&#233;. Additionally, Twelve Months 2020 included a $34.0 million cash outflow to Ik&#233; Grupo for the Ik&#233; Loan that was repaid and reflected as a net cash inflow for Twelve Months 2021. These increases were partially offset by the absence of $197.1 million of net cash provided by consolidated investment entities and a $66.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment mostly due to continued investments in information technology supporting our core operations. 

Financing Activities &#160; 

Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $818.4 million and $1.09 billion for Twelve Months 2022 and Twelve Months 2021, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower cash outflow for share repurchases, mainly funded by the net proceeds from the Global Preneed sale. 

Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $1.09 billion and $264.8 million for Twelve Months 2021 and Twelve Months 2020, respectively. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was mainly due to a $542.3 million increase in share repurchases, mainly funded by the net proceeds from the Global Preneed sale, the issuance of the 5.25% subordinated notes due January 2061 with an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million, net of issuance costs, of $243.7 million in Twelve Months 2020, the $50.0 million repayment of our floating rate senior notes due March 2021 in first quarter 2021 and the loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of our 4.00% senior notes due March 2023. 

Discontinued operations 

Changes in cash flows from the operating and investing activities from our discontinued operations for Twelve Months 2021 as compared to Twelve Months 2020 were lower mainly due to Twelve Months 2021 including only seven months of net cash flows since the sale closed on August 2, 2021. 

The table below shows our cash outflows for taxes, interest and dividends for the periods indicated: 

##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Income taxes paid $ 127.7 $ 221.1 $ 98.5 Interest paid on debt 108.4 109.8 103.6 Common stock dividends 150.2 157.6 154.6 Preferred stock dividends &#8212; 4.7 18.7 Total $ 386.3 $ 493.2 $ 375.4 ##TABLE_END

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

We have contractual obligations and commitments to third parties as a result of our operations, as detailed in the table below by maturity date as of December 31, 2022: &#160; 

##TABLE_START &#160; As of December 31, 2022 &#160; Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years 

Contractual obligations : 

Insurance liabilities (1) $ 2,116.8 $ 1,506.4 $ 462.1 $ 81.1 $ 67.2 Debt and related interest 3,830.9 328.8 193.3 193.3 3,115.5 Operating leases 42.0 15.9 19.2 6.1 0.8 Pension obligations and postretirement benefits (2) 495.5 56.1 106.8 101.3 231.3 Commitments: Investment purchases outstanding: Commercial mortgage loans on real estate 7.9 7.9 Capital contributions to non-consolidated VIEs 143.6 143.6 Liability for unrecognized tax benefits 20.4 16.9 3.5 Total obligations and commitments $ 6,657.1 $ 2,058.7 $ 798.3 $ 381.8 $ 3,418.3 ##TABLE_END

(1) Insurance liabilities reflect undiscounted estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders, net of expected future premium cash receipts on in-force policies and excluding fully reinsured runoff operations. The total gross reserve for fully reinsured runoff operations that was excluded was $607.9 million which, if the reinsurers defaulted, would be payable over a 30+ year period with the majority of the payments occurring after 5 years. Additional information on the reinsurance arrangements can be found in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. These liabilities also do not include recoverable amounts related to certain high deductible policies in our sharing economy business, included in our non-core operations, for which we are responsible for paying the entirety of the claim and are subsequently reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. As of December 31, 2022, we had exposure to $379.1 million of reserves below the deductible that we would be responsible for if the clients were to default on their contractual obligation to pay us the deductible. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information on our evaluation of the credit risk exposure from these recoverables. As a result, the amounts presented in this table do not agree to the future policy benefits and expenses and claims and benefits payable in the consolidated balance sheets. 

(2) Our pension obligations and postretirement benefits include an Assurant Pension Plan, various non-qualified pension plans (including an Executive Pension Plan) and certain life and health care benefits for retired employees and their dependents (&#8220;Retirement Health Benefits&#8221;), all of which were frozen in 2016. In February 2020, we amended the Retirement Health Benefits to terminate such plan benefits to retirees effective December 31, 2024. Due to the Assurant Pension Plan&#8217;s current overfunded status, no contributions were made during 2022 and none are expected to be made in 2023. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information. 

Liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses have been included in the commitments and contingencies table. Significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, contract terms and the timing of payments.
